Abstract = {One of the most important reasons for utilising virtual environments is
   to increase the flexibility of participating in education. Videos are a
   widely utilised technological solution for realising this type of
   flexible education. An educational model that videos are especially well
   suited for is flipped learning. However, the absence of contact teaching
   poses challenges for flipped learning, in which traditionally
   lecture-heavy activities are arranged as self-studies while face-to-face
   classes are used for cooperative studying. This paper examines a
   piloting of flipped learning organised alongside a video-based blended
   education model. The pilot provides experience of how flipped learning
   functions in an educational environment where the flexibility of
   participation is a priority, participation is mostly done asynchronously
   using on-demand videos, and in which students make practically no use of
   contact teaching. Based on the observations, the paper's discussion
   section presents some noteworthy considerations, as well as possible
   solutions for challenges identified during the piloting.},

Title = {Effects of Self-Regulated Learning Prompts at Three Different Phases in
   Video-Based Learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {The current study examined the influences of self-regulated learning
   prompts provided during three different self-regulated learning phases
   in video-based learning. A total of 58 college students from a
   midwestern university were randomly assigned into one of the four
   conditions: (1) self-regulated learning prompts at the forethought
   phase, (2) self-regulated learning prompts at the performance phase, (3)
   self-regulated learning prompts at the self-reflection phase, and (4) no
   self-regulated learning prompts in any phase. Participants watched a
   video on the human respiratory system and responded to the
   self-regulated learning prompts in one of the three phases or no
   prompts. Upon completing the video, participants responded to a
   questionnaire assessing their self-regulated learning levels and
   learning outcome. Self-regulated learning levels were also inferred by
   learners' behavior of pausing and rewinding during video-watching.
   Results indicated that participants who received self-regulated learning
   prompts at the performance phase achieved better learning outcome
   compared to those in the no prompt condition.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of an integrated approach that combines
   segmentation and self-explanation designs on learner achievement for
   meaningful video-based learning. This was a pretest-posttest research
   design with a sample size of 121 participants randomly assigned to one
   of four different types of video instructions (continuous, segmentation,
   self-explanation, or the combination of segmentation and
   self-explanation). Participants engaged in video instruction that used
   either a continuous video or segmented video clips and incorporated
   either self-explanation prompts or no self-explanation prompts. The
   results showed that participants in the combination and segmentation
   conditions outperformed those in the continuous condition in evaluation
   ability, and participants in the combination condition outperformed
   those in the continuous condition in the overall performance after
   controlling for prior knowledge. The current study indicates that the
   combined design can effectively facilitate student learning by engaging
   them in meaningful video-based learning.},

Title = {The effects of self-controlled video feedback on motor learning and
   self-efficacy in a Physical Education setting: an exploratory study on
   the shot-put},

Abstract = {Background: Laboratory studies have shown that self-controlled (video)
   feedback benefits motor learning and self-motivational beliefs. These
   outcomes are relevant to Physical Education (PE), but need to be
   verified for PE settings, in which practice and feedback need to be
   organized in large groups rather than individually as is common in
   laboratory studies.Purpose: The main aim of this study was to examine
   the effects of self-controlled video feedback on students' motor
   learning and self-efficacy in a PE setting when students obtain feedback
   relatively independent of the teacher. The secondary aim was to examine
   to what extent self-control and self-efficacy during practice predicted
   students' motor learning.Method: Participants were 56 grade 1 students
   of a regular secondary school who practised the shot-put during four
   practice sessions organized during PE lessons. One class practised with
   self-controlled video feedback (SC-VF group, n=22). They practised
   relatively independent of the teacher: peers filmed each other and
   analysed the recorded video with help from video applications, a video
   model and cue cards. A second class practised in a similar fashion.
   However, they were yoked to the first group and could not choose the
   timing and frequency of feedback delivery (externally controlled video
   feedback, EC-VF group, n=17). A third group practised in a traditional
   way (teacher guided TG group, n=17) with demonstrations, verbal
   instructions and feedback from a PE teacher. Shot-put distance, shot-put
   technique and self-efficacy were measured in a pre- (week 1), post-
   (week 8) and retention (week 9) test. During practice (weeks 2-7,
   including four practice sessions), students rated their self-efficacy.
   After the last practice session, students rated their perceptions
   towards practice (i.e. perceived enjoyment and perceived learning
   effect). Hierarchical two-stepped linear regression analyses were
   performed to explore whether the type of intervention (SC-VF, EC-VF or
   TG group) and self-efficacy during practice predicted motor
   learning.Findings: Results showed that shot-put distance and technique
   increased significantly after practice, without differences between
   groups. Self-efficacy improved significantly after practice for the
   SC-VF (from pre- to retention test) and the TG groups (from pre- to
   post- and retention test), but not for the EC-VF group. Furthermore,
   students in the SC-VF group reported a higher perceived learning effect,
   compared to students in the EC-VF group. No differences in perceived
   enjoyment were found. Finally, self-efficacy during practice predicted
   improvements in shot-put technique from pre- to retention
   test.Conclusion: Self-controlled video feedback without guidance of a
   teacher on movement technique led to similar learning effects as
   traditional guidance of the teacher in a PE context. Self-control of
   feedback delivery (i.e. timing and frequency) seemed to have positive
   effects on self-efficacy and perceived learning effect, but did not lead
   to superior motor learning or perceived enjoyment. This study indicates
   that self-controlled video feedback as applied in this study can be
   implemented in PE. Future research that investigates whether and how the
   application of self-controlled video feedback can be further optimized,
   also for different types of skills, is needed. Furthermore, monitoring
   the application of self-regulatory skills seems important for further
   understanding the effects of self-controlled video feedback.},

Title = {Self-regulated learning support in flipped learning videos enhances
   learning outcomes},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {158},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In flipped learning, students study learning material before class and
   apply the content of the learning material during class. This requires
   self-regulated learning (SRL) behavior due to the increased autonomy in
   this instructional approach. Providing students with video-embedded SRL
   support (i.e., prompts and explicit instruction) during the learning
   activities before class has proven to be an effective strategy in
   primary and higher education to enhance students' SRL and learning
   outcomes. The current study aims to replicate the effects of SRL support
   in a Flipped class in secondary education over the course of eight
   weeks. In total, 115 eighth-grade students from five classes
   participated in a quasi-experimental study, which measured the effects
   of SRL support on students' SRL (self-reports and online activities),
   learning outcomes, and satisfaction. We found a positive effect of SRL
   support on learning outcomes, but we could not explain this by
   differences in students' SRL. Although all the students were generally
   positive about the flipped learning environment, some students clearly
   disliked the SRL instruction. We conclude that SRL support is beneficial
   for students' learning but that it should be carefully designed to avoid
   students' dissatisfaction, which could potentially nullify these
   beneficial effects on learning.},

Abstract = {It is urgent to take actions to reduce the level of educational failure
   and increase the resources for education, because not doing so can get
   out much more expensive. Nowadays the educational system is focused on
   learning competences adapted to the necessities of Society. Among the
   critical competences students should develop along their way through
   undergraduate studies are oral and written skills.
   This experience is focused on the shooting of educational videos as a
   learning tool for the laboratory experiments carried out in the
   Chemistry subjects, at Pharmacy Grade (University of Seville) in order
   to promote the development of relevant competences. Furthermore, the
   self-production of laboratory experience-based videos that can be
   uploaded later to ``YouTube{''} video website, leads to a remarkable
   input of the student in their own learning procedure, as well as
   facilitates the task of writing their personal laboratory-notebook.},

Title = {Choosing YouTube Videos for Self-Directed Learning},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {51155-51166},
Abstract = {YouTube provides a vital source for self-directed learning. YouTube's
   search engine, however, ranks videos according to popularity, relevancy,
   and view history rather than quality. The effect of this ranking on
   learners' behavior and experience is not clear: Do learners tend to
   choose from the top of the returned search list? Does the choosing
   behavior affect their learning? Is the type of sought knowledge relevant
   in this process? To answer these questions, we conducted two experiments
   with sophomore-level students in electrical and computer engineering
   programs. The students were asked to learn about two new topics by
   watching YouTube videos of their choice. The first topic conveys
   procedural knowledge about using the Quine McCluskey algorithm for
   minimizing logical functions. The second topic relates to the concept of
   the set-reset latch. In each learning session, the students had to
   report their watching behavior and experience by responding to an online
   questionnaire as well as to solve a problem related to the respective
   topic. The results show a clear tendency to choose from the top of the
   returned list. However, students' performance in problem-solving was
   found to be uncorrelated with the choosing behavior. These results were
   similar for procedural and conceptual learning although the students'
   performance in solving the conceptual problem was significantly lower.
   These findings indicate that university students who seek YouTube for
   self-directed learning can freely choose from the top of the returned
   search list without concern. There is no evident harm in doing so.
   However, students need to be thoughtful when using YouTube for
   conceptual learning. They should use different strategies such as
   watching multiple videos, selecting videos with higher viewer ratings,
   or watching videos with related procedural knowledge to support the
   learning of new concepts.},

Title = {Peer Assessment and Video Feedback for Fostering Self, Co, and Shared
   Regulation of Learning in a Higher Education Language Classroom},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Self-regulated learning includes the cognitive, metacognitive,
   behavioral, motivational, and affective aspects of learning. The
   conceptualization of self and socially regulated learning has recently
   received much attention and peer assessment has been found to increase
   the use of metacognitive activity. The present exploratory qualitative
   study aimed to identify self-, co-, and socially shared regulatory
   processes in an oral English as a Foreign Language task. The regulatory
   activity deployed by 10 learners was studied within the context of a
   peer assessment task using an assessment form paired with video feedback
   in the context of an English language classroom at a French university.
   These interactions were filmed and discussed in individual
   self-confrontation interviews which were analyzed through inductive
   coding. Specific findings from the classroom setting shed light on
   existing gaps in the literature. First, students can gain confidence in
   their own skills through assessing their peers and activating regulatory
   processes both individually and as a group. Second, appropriate tools
   can increase co-regulated and socially regulated learning through the
   structuring of cooperative regulatory behaviors. Third, psychological
   safety appeared to be a propitious social context for supporting
   regulated learning (SRL, CoRL, and SSRL). We also shed light on the fact
   that adaptive regulatory strategies are present in oral (as well as
   written) English as a Foreign Language tasks. These results indicate the
   potential for learning situations based on video feedback used in
   conjunction with peer assessment and collaborative learning in order to
   develop regulatory behaviors in language learners.},

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Age (4IA) is likely to be accompanied
   simultaneously by an increase in technology-mediated learning and an
   urgent need for people to leam rapidly, effectively and collaboratively.
   This study investigates the potential of vicarious teaming from videoed
   tutorials as a pedagogical tool suitable for the challenges of 4IA.
   Undergraduate Business students observed videos of student tutees
   responding to tutor prompts as they tackled openended and conceptually
   challenging problems. The results revealed that student observers
   self-reported: gains in their conceptual understanding from watching
   videoed tutorials; preferences for watching tutorial dialogues over
   alternative learning methods; and that watching videoed tutorials had
   positive impacts on their affect and access to additional
   learning-related information. The study concludes that vicarious teaming
   from videoed tutorials is an accessible technology-mediated pedagogy
   that is achievable by mainstream educators and is effective in
   developing conceptual understanding, engaging students and providing
   access to additional learning-related information.},

Abstract = {Technology can support teaching, learning and assessment in physical
   education. The purpose of this study was to examine children's
   perspectives and experiences of using digital video in primary physical
   education. The impact on motivation, feedback, self-assessment and
   learning was examined. Twenty-three children aged 9-10 years
   participated in a 10-week intervention which focused on learning
   basketball skills. Digital video was used to provide feedback and
   support self-assessment using rubrics. The project design involved a
   qualitative inquiry where data was collected through focus groups,
   interviews with the children and children's skill self-assessments.
   Teacher skill assessments and teacher research diary entries supported
   triangulation of data. Self-assessment using digital video impacted
   positively on student performance. Students were motivated and engaged
   by the feedback provided as well as the self-assessment process. Digital
   video can enhance motivation, feedback and performance in skill learning
   in primary physical education.},

Abstract = {We propose a self-supervised method to learn feature representations
   from videos. A standard approach in traditional self-supervised methods
   uses positive-negative data pairs to train with contrastive learning
   strategy. In such a case, different modalities of the same video are
   treated as positives and video clips from a different video are treated
   as negatives. Because the spatio-temporal information is important for
   video representation, we extend the negative samples by introducing
   intra-negative samples, which are transformed from the same anchor video
   by breaking temporal relations in video clips. With the proposed
   Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework, we can train spatio-temporal
   convolutional networks to learn video representations. There are many
   flexible options in our IIC framework and we conduct experiments by
   using several different configurations. Evaluations are conducted on
   video retrieval and video recognition tasks using the learned video
   representation. Our proposed IIC outperforms current state-of-the-art
   results by a large margin, such as 16.7\% and 9.5\% points improvements
   in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video retrieval,
   respectively. For video recognition, improvements can also be obtained
   on these two benchmark datasets. Code is available at https:

Abstract = {Video in education has become pervasive. Globally, educators are
   recording instructional videos to augment their students' learning and,
   in many contexts, replace face-to-face lectures. However, the mere act
   of watching a video is primarily a passive learning experience likely
   leading to lack of student engagement hindering learning. Active
   learning strategies such as video annotations and in-video questions
   have the potential to shift the passive experience of watching an
   instructional video to a more active one by engaging students with
   learning strategies designed to promote self-regulated learning and
   improve content knowledge. This experimental study investigates the
   impact of in-video questions compared to video annotations on learning
   and self-efficacy in an experimental setting. Findings revealed that
   learners who annotated videos had higher self-efficacy than those who
   completed in-video questions likely due to the immediate feedback
   received from the in-video questions. The study further concluded that
   prior knowledge plays a critical role in selecting appropriate active
   learning strategies, suggesting that video annotations be considered
   when students have prior knowledge about a topic whereas in-video
   questions with immediate feedback be interspersed in videos when
   students do not have prior knowledge about a topic.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a survey on video games in learning and education,
   including patterns and trends in technologies and correlations in
   popularity with regard to the entertainment industry. The fact that
   games have the ability to engage and captivate a person's attention for
   long periods of time, while offering numerous additional benefits, such
   as, developing high-level thinking skills, is extremely attractive and
   important. The capacity to unconsciously learn and master complex
   concepts through video games has enormous benefit in learning (beyond
   simple `educational' games, such as, sharpening focus, responsiveness,
   and collaborative working). As we show in this paper, research dating
   right back to the early 1980s has consistently demonstrated that playing
   computer games (irrespective of genre) develops faster reaction times,
   improved hand-eye co-ordination and raises players' self-esteem. We
   review video game literature in the area of education (and learning) and
   how technologies are changing traditional learning paradigms (e.g.,
   mobile devices and virtual reality). What is more, we also review the
   disadvantages of video games in certain contexts and debate the reasons
   for their failures - but more importantly what measures are necessary to
   ensure video games facilitate as an educational `aid' and not a
   `hindrance'. Having said that, we deliberate on questions, such as, what
   makes an `educational game' and how is the design and structure
   different from a traditional `video game'? Above all, educational video
   games have changed enormously over the past few decades, with a greater
   emphasis on understanding the audience, learning objectives and
   evaluation mechanisms to `guarantee' the game is successful and
   accomplishes its end goal - as we discuss, this is embodied by a whole
   assortment of elements, from psychology, age, gender and technological
   factors to social and usability development. In conclusion, video games
   connect with a vast assortment of areas, such as, medicine and robotics,
   but most importantly, education and learning. With video games one of
   the largest growing sectors, we contemplate how past research and recent
   developments in technologies are changing the learning and educational
   sector for the better, thereby gaining insights into future strength and
   directions.},

Abstract = {Parallel to the tremendous growth and expansion of video technology, it
   is easy and enjoyable for students to create a video as a learning
   activity. However, most previous studies primarily focused on
   declarative knowledge learning (e.g., language learning, science
   learning) rather than motor skill learning. The current study aimed to
   investigate whether creating and sharing a video with classmates would
   be more effective than merely creating a video and self-exercise to
   learn a motor skill in terms of intrinsic motivation, perseverance in
   learning, learning satisfaction, and roller-skating skill. Partially
   consistent with our hypothesis, we found that creating and sharing a
   video with classmates increased students' intrinsic motivation,
   perseverance in motor tasks, and learning satisfaction, but not
   roller-skating skill, followed by merely creating a video and then
   self-exercise. The findings have an important implication for motor
   skills learning: during teaching motor skills, teachers can use
   encourage students to create and share a video with classmates as a
   homework activity to increase students' intrinsic motivation,
   perseverance in motor tasks, and learning satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate student-created video as an
   active learning approach in an online environment to inform
   instructional practices of student-created video in STEM. Data analyzed
   in this study included pre-service teachers N = 107, 1-minute videos and
   pre- and post surveys. The findings of this qualitative study indicated
   that student-created video was an active learning activity that
   contributed to an increase in students' perceived STEM content
   knowledge, improved perceptions of self-efficacy, and evidence of
   student engagement inclusive of behavioral, affective, and cognitive
   domains. Themes derived from the participants' perceptions included:
   perceived self-efficacy, novelty or usefulness of creating short video,
   time to design and create video, and content and technical knowledge.
   Student-created video as an active approach to learning can be included
   in STEM education to increase STEM knowledge and foster integrative
   twenty-first Century skills. Practical implications for educators when
   designing student-created video assignments include (a) following a
   video development model; (b) providing extra time for content
   acquisition and revisions; and (c) incorporating peer evaluations.},

Abstract = {This article describes a study on the use of learning videos in
   handicraft technologies for adult interests' education. Working with
   adults with different learning rate and different previously acquired
   knowledge, the use of learning videos, that include visible handicraft
   technology demonstration step-by-step, provides improvement of adult
   education. The aim of this study is to explore and justify the need of
   the use of learning video for adult interests' education, learning the
   fine handicraft technology from Deco Clay polymer. Pedagogical
   experiment was carried., out in Latvia University of Agriculture in
   Institute of Education and Home Economics and in the flower formation
   studio `Madeira Flowerland' in Jelgava, interviewing studio
   participants. It was studied how the use of learning video promotes
   precise learning of the exact flower-making technology. The criteria for
   assessing the use of learning video were set up. The materials of
   learning videos for handicraft technology from Japan Deco Clay polymer
   for adult interests' education were developed and tested in practice.
   Basic principles of adult education were applied through the process of
   using the learning videos (continuing education accessibility,
   connectivity with the own' experience, ``learning by doing{''}); as well
   as adult education favourable didactic elements (learning in their own
   home and at the individual rate); individual develops skills to see the
   proportions, to perceive space, to create flower compositions and
   improves information technology skills. As a result individual's
   horizons expanded and personal development took place. Usage of learning
   video creates the conditions that supports relation between individual's
   autonomy and competence with her/his own experience, encourages
   creativity, motivation and personal development during learning process,
   thus improving learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Person re-identification is an important task in video surveillance,
   focusing on finding the same person across different cameras. However,
   most existing methods of video-based person re-identification still have
   some limitations (e.g., the lack of effective deep learning framework,
   the robustness of the model, and the same treatment for all video
   frames) which make them unable to achieve better recognition
   performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced learning
   algorithm for video-based person re-identification, which could
   gradually learn from simple to complex samples for a mature and stable
   model. Self-paced learning is employed to enhance video based person
   re-identification based on deep neural network, so that deep neural
   network and self-paced learning are unified into one frame. Then, based
   on the trained self-paced learning, we propose to employ deep
   reinforcement learning to discard misleading and confounding frames and
   find the most representative frames from video pairs. With the advantage
   of deep reinforcement learning, our method can learn strategies to
   select the optimal frame groups. Experiments show that the proposed
   framework outperforms the existing methods on the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011
   and MARS datasets.},

Title = {Self-explanation prompts in video learning: an optimization study},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 27},
Abstract = {The self-explanation strategy motivates learners to actively select and
   integrate information, thereby fostering meaningful learning. To
   generate comprehensive and insightful explanations, learners often
   require support. However, there is a limited understanding of the
   optimal form of self-explanation that effectively assists learners in
   applying this strategy in video learning environments. This study tests
   various self-explanation prompts, using multiple indicators, including
   learning outcomes, cognitive load, intrinsic motivation, and engagement,
   to measure effects. Participants (n = 143) were randomly assigned to
   five conditions: No Strategy, Focused, Visual Scaffold, Fill-in-blank
   Scaffold, and Rewrite Scaffold. Results indicate that scaffolded
   self-explanation prompts enhance learning performance and notably reduce
   cognitive load, with the Fill-in-blank scaffold demonstrating
   significant advantages. However, the impact on intrinsic motivation and
   engagement is not clearly pronounced. To optimize self-explanation
   strategy's effectiveness, it is recommended to provide tailored support
   based on content difficulty and learners' proficiency levels,
   facilitating active participation at a balanced cognitive load level.},

Title = {Curiosity in Online Video Concept Learning and Short-Term Outcomes in
   Blended Medical Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: A student's level of curiosity in a subject after learning
   about it through online videos has not been addressed well in the
   medical education field. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to
   investigate online learning's effect on the stimulation of curiosity and
   short-term learning outcomes in a blended framework of precision medical
   education.Methods: A mixed-methods research design was used. During the
   2020 academic year, all fifth-year medical students who, prior to class,
   viewed 6 video clips that presented 6 core concepts were invited to
   complete a survey and self-reflection on their learning process to
   assess their level of curiosity in each concept. For each group of
   medical students, teaching assistants helped collect anonymous survey
   data and summative assessment scores representing the students' learning
   outcomes. Video-viewing patterns, attained through an action log
   transformation, were also coded for analysis. Mann-Whitney U and
   Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed to compare differences between
   groups, and multiple linear regression was used to select the factors
   affecting learning outcomes. Qualitative data were content-coded through
   a descriptive approach using thematic analysis.Results: Of 142 medical
   students, 136 watched the online videos, 124 responded to the
   questionnaires, and 92 provided comments. Students' curiosity levels
   after learning about each concept through online videos significantly
   correlated with the degree to which a concept was learned. Medical
   students spent a median of 1.6 h online, and pause frequency correlated
   with curiosity in certain concepts. Aroused curiosity was associated
   with short-term learning outcomes in inconsistent effect sizes and
   directions. Students' feedback revealed various dimensions of curiosity,
   including novelty acknowledgment, recognition of an information gap, and
   information-seeking requests.Conclusions: Curiosity can be induced
   through online video learning platforms and has a role in short-term
   learning outcomes in medical education.},

Title = {Effect of self-learning media based on 360° virtual reality for learning
   periodontal instrument skills},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Introduction Of 360 degrees Virtual Reality (VR) is possibly produced
   and sufficiently effective as a consumer-friendly VR learning medium.
   Therefore, it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice
   field, as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training
   during the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study was
   conducted to assess 360 degrees VR self-learning media for a periodontal
   instrument operation. Materials and Methods We recruited 30 participants
   who had never experienced instrument training. We offered basic
   education and initial assessment (IA), then divided them into three
   groups: 1) PAPER: trained only with paper handouts; 2) 2D: trained with
   2D video; 3) VR: trained with 360 degrees VR. Each group performed
   self-learning and mid-term assessment (MA). Subjects then implemented
   home self-learning with the same media for one week, which was then
   followed by a final assessment (FA). Result Analysis of IA-to-FA
   improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher
   than the PAPER groups. Meanwhile, analysis of MA-to-FA improvement
   scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER
   group. Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different,
   VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score
   analyses. Discussion Both 2D video and 360 degrees VR training were
   helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good
   portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods. 360
   degrees VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video,
   possibly due to its autonomy, 360 degrees visual information and
   physical and immersive characteristics, which positively affected
   self-training. Conclusion Our findings showed the potential of 360
   degrees VR learning media and, further, suggest its usefulness as a
   novel self-learning method in future dental education.},

Abstract = {The self-paced nature of asynchronous online learning (AOL) is
   recognized as an obstacle that disrupts student success in the learning
   environment. Without on-time interventions provided by instructors,
   students find it challenging to use learning strategies tailored to the
   learning environment, and their use of self-regulated learning (SRL)
   strategies has been regarded one of the key indicators of success in
   AOL. To examine how student SRL strategies are associated with their
   video engagement trajectory and learning outcomes, we used student video
   engagement data collected at multiple time points. Participants were 159
   students who were taking a self-paced asynchronous online statistics
   course. Results revealed that student video engagement was found to
   increase over time and student management strategies contributed to the
   upward change. We also found that the growth of engagement predicted
   student achievement in the course. Our findings shed light on
   instructional strategies to support students in AOL contexts.},

Abstract = {This study aims to design a video-based learning environment using
   workflow and scaffolding to enhance self-instructional video production
   ability of pre-service teacher and to explore the impacts of the use of
   the designed video-based learning environment on learning. The
   methodology was divided into two main phases. In the first phase, a
   video-based learning environment was designed using workflow and
   scaffolding. In the second phase, the impacts of the use of the
   developed video-based learning environment on learning were
   investigated. The samples were 47 undergraduate students at the School
   of Education, University of Phayao. The results were, as follows: (a)
   The design draft of the developed video-based learning environment was
   appropriate, and the revision was made according to six criteria: (1)
   instructional media, (2) content, (3) learning activities, (4)
   communication devices, (5) learning management systems, and (6) screen
   design. The analysis of related studies and documents, the instructional
   video production process consisted of three steps: (1) design, (2)
   development, and (3) video delivery. (b) The comparison of scores on the
   instructional video production knowledge test revealed that the
   pre-service teachers' average post-test score was higher than the
   average pre-test score with a statistically significant difference at
   the .05 level. The assessment of instructional videos, it was found that
   the pre-service teachers in the field of humanities obtained a higher
   score than those in the field of science. Male pre-service teachers
   received a higher score than female pre-service teachers. The average
   suit-ability score indicated the overall appropriateness of the
   developed video-based learning environment.},

Title = {The impact of complete denture making instructional videos on
   self-directed learning of clinical skills},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {59},
Number = {2},
Pages = {144-151},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a
   clinical instructional video with a structured worksheet for independent
   self-study in a complete denture program.
   Methods: 47 multilingual dental students completed a task by watching an
   instructional video with subtitles regarding clinical complete denture
   procedures. After completion, students evaluated their learning
   experience, and 11 students participated in focus group interviews to
   gain further insight. A mixed-methods approach to data collection and
   analysis provided descriptive statistical results and a grounded theory
   approach to coding identified key concepts and categories from the
   qualitative data.
   Results: Over 70\% of students had favorable opinions of the learning
   experience and indicated that the speed and length of the video were
   appropriate. Highly positive and conflicting negative comments regarding
   the use of subtitles showed both preferences for subtitles over audio
   and vice versa. The use of a video resource was considered valuable as
   the replay and review functions allowed better visualization of the
   procedures, which was considered a good recap tool for the clinical
   demonstration. It was also a better revision aid than textbooks. So, if
   the students were able to view these videos at will, they believed that
   videos supplemented their self-study. Despite the positive response,
   videos were not considered to replace live clinical demonstrations.
   Conclusions: While students preferred live demonstrations over the
   clinical videos they did express a realization of these as a
   supplemental learning material for self-study based on their ease of
   access, use for revision, and prior to clinical preparation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {In the process of psychiatry teaching, through students' self-made video
   of mental disorders, their learning interests and learning results can
   be stimulated as well as medical students' professional ethical
   awareness and humanistic quality can be improved. Compared with
   traditional teaching methods such as theoretical teaching and PBL, case
   discussions, etc., self-made video teaching methods are more novel,
   which makes students have a higher interest, and offer better teaching
   results.},

Journal = {SOCIAL WORK EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 28},
Abstract = {This study focused on the implementation of case-based teaching videos
   on e-learning platform and the effect of these videos on the
   self-regulated learning outcomes of students in a community work course.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between
   students' learning behaviors and self-regulated learning and the effect
   of students' self-regulated learning on their learning performance. This
   study employed a pre-experiment and a single-group, posttest design with
   a 4-month research period. The research participants were 44 social work
   students of a community work course at a university in Taiwan. The
   results of this study indicated that in self-regulated learning,
   case-based teaching videos had a positive effect on the learning
   motivation of all students and the information processing of students
   who achieved high scores in the final exam. Viewing case-based teaching
   videos enhanced the students' academic performance. When the videos
   matched the personal experience of and aroused empathy among the
   students, their learning motivation increased. Academic performance
   improved when the videos were linked to practical experience, clarified
   confusing concepts, and could be watched multiple times. Discussions and
   suggestions regarding the design of case-based teaching videos and the
   relationship between students' learning behaviors and self-regulated
   learning are presented.},

Abstract = {Although many adults who cannot swim are primarily interested in
   learning by direct coaching there are options that have a focus on
   self-directed learning. As an alternative a self -management program
   combined with video modelling, video feedback and high quality and
   affordable video technology was used to assess its effectiveness to
   assisting an adult to develop and practice swimming skills. The
   participant was a 36 year-old non-swimmer who had previously attempted
   unsuccessfully to learn to swim on previous occasions. A single subject
   design with baseline, intervention and 12-month post intervention phase
   were conducted. Dependent variables included a continuous 25-metre
   swimming distance goal using the freestyle stroke. After a 13-week
   intervention phase the continuous swimming distance had increased to 25
   metres. For this adult participant, self managed learning proved to be
   an effective way to learn to swim and greatly improved her confidence
   around deep water.},

Title = {How can video feedback be used in physical education to support novice
   learning in gymnastics? Effects on motor learning, self-assessment and
   motivation},

Abstract = {Background: Much of the existing research concerning the use of video
   feedback (VFB) to enhance motor learning has been undertaken under
   strictly controlled experimental conditions. Few studies have sought to
   explore the impact of VFB on the skill learning experience of the
   students in a structured, school-based physical education (PE) setting.
   Most of those studies have only used qualitative approaches to implicate
   the potential value of VFB to enhance skill acquisition, students'
   engagement or self-assessment ability. Using a quantitative approach,
   the aim of this study was to investigate effects of using VFB on motor
   skill acquisition, self-assessment ability and motivation in a
   school-based learning environment (structured PE programme) with novice
   children learning a gymnastic skill. Method: Two French classes of
   beginners took part in a typical five-week learning programme in
   gymnastics. During each of the five, weekly lessons participants carried
   out the same warm-up routine and exercises. The experimental group (10
   girls - 8 boys, 12.4 +/- 0.5 years) received VFB intermittently when
   learning a front handstand to flat back landing. VFB was given after
   every five attempts, combined with self-assessment and verbal
   instructions from the teacher. The control group (12 girls - 13 boys,
   12.6 +/- 0.4 years) received exactly the same training but was not given
   VFB. In order to assess progress in motor skills, the arm-trunk angle
   (hand-shoulder-hip) was measured in the sagittal plane just as the hips
   formed a vertical line with the shoulders. Motivation was assessed using
   the Situational Motivation Scale questionnaire (Guay, F., R. J.
   Vallerand, and C. Blanchard. 2000. ``On the Assessment of Situational
   Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: The Situational Motivation Scale
   (SIMS).{''} Motivation and Emotion 24 (3): 175-213), and self-assessment
   ability was measured by self-perception task scores. Results:
   Statistical analysis of arm-trunk angle values showed significant
   differences only for the VFB group between the fifth lesson and all
   other lessons. Between lessons 4 and 5, the arm-trunk angle value
   increased significantly from 146.6 +/- 16.9 degrees to 161.2 +/- 14.2
   degrees (p < .001; ES = 0.94). Self-assessment scores improved
   significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1 and lesson 2 (p < 0.01,
   ES = 1.79) and between lesson 4 to lesson 5 (p < .01, ES = 0.94).
   Amotivation decreased significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1
   and lesson 5 (3.06 +/- 1.42 vs. 2.12 +/- 0.62, p < .001, ES = -0.89).
   Discussion/conclusion: Our quantitative data, identifying key movement
   changes as a function of experience in a structured PE programme, were
   congruent with outcomes of previous qualitative research supporting the
   role of VFB. This study highlights the potential relevance of using VFB
   in fostering motor learning, motivation and self-assessment during a PE
   programme with young children. Future pedagogical research is needed to
   examine the ways students could use VFB technology for greater
   self-regulation, with the potential to deliver appropriate movement
   feedback, based on different levels of experience in students.},

Abstract = {Building the general feature from unlabeled videos is the core of
   self-supervised video representation learning. However, recent research
   on video representation focuses on static visual pixel information,
   which makes these models unable to capture the dynamics in the temporal
   dimension. In order to solve the aforementioned issue and improve the
   generalization of the model, we propose an enhanced motion visual cue
   (EMVC) method for self-supervised video representation learning to
   reduce the background bias and increase the motion information. Our EMVC
   includes a background replacing module and a foreground fixing module
   that leverages the foreground and background of the original video
   sequence to make the background of same-action videos less identical and
   their motion cues more distinct. Experimental results show that the
   proposed method effectively reduces the biases in the background and
   significantly improves the video's ability to comprehend motion
   information, leading to an increase in recognition accuracy.
   Specifically, the EMVC method achieved an accuracy of 84.6\%, 53.1\%,
   and 68.3\% on the UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48 datasets, respectively,
   outperforming the existing algorithms. Additionally, significant
   improvements were obtained in the video retrieval task on benchmark
   datasets, with an average improvement of over 14.6\%.},

Abstract = {Video modeling is a type of observational learning that can influence
   students' motor skill development. The present study was designed to
   investigate the influence of video modeling on students' self-regulation
   in physical education classes. Two classes of 45 students (24 boys and
   21 girls) aged 8 years were randomly assigned into two groups: the class
   that observed a video of an expert model performing the kick was the
   video modeling group; and the class that observed their teacher's
   performance was the live modeling group. Students were taught football
   skills, twice a week for four weeks. Before and after the intervention,
   students had to perform a kick in a soccer box. The use of
   self-regulation strategies during the tests was assessed through
   structured interview questions after performances. The statistical
   analysis showed that both groups developed their self-regulation
   abilities. The results of this study suggest that video modeling
   improves self-regulation in children and should be used by
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {This research investigated the details and effects of a short online
   Professional Learning Program designed to develop teacher education
   students' knowledge about how to promote self-regulated learning (SRL)
   in the classroom. The Program was based on a new framework for how
   teachers can promote SRL, the SRL Teacher Promotion Framework (SRL-TPF),
   which focused on the promotion of SRL strategies, students' knowledge
   about learning, and students' metacognition. It consisted of seven
   modules describing the different SRL promotion types and SRL
   capabilities and ways to promote them through teacher talk and action.
   Modules included written information and video examples taken from
   observations of real classrooms, which were used to illustrate the
   transfer of SRL theory to instructional practice. Each module concluded
   with several assessment items. During the Program the participants, 91
   teacher education students, were asked to use a simplified scoring
   system based on the SRL-TPF to code lesson transcripts taken from
   classroom observations. The results showed that by the end of the
   program over 85\% of the participants were able to provide teacher
   instructions that included explicit SRL promotion and/or promoted
   students' SRL knowledge. Our study contributes to research findings on
   teacher education students' knowledge of SRL, their promotion of SRL to
   students, and the contribution of short duration SRL professional
   development.},

Abstract = {Several publications claim positive effects of learning videos - in
   addition to indications of increased motivation among learners, studies
   suggest that learning performance can be increased {[}1-3]. With a focus
   on digital transformation, this paper will consider a self-study-video
   in the field of university education. The content of the investigated
   self-study-video is a central model of occupational safety: the design
   model of protective measures. The presented short intervention was
   designed as self-study-video based on an existing textbook chapter.
   Besides the evaluation of design elements, it was investigated which
   effects learning videos may have on the motivation and learning
   performance of students learning the design model. Students of the
   University of Wuppertal were the sample for the intervention. The study
   population were Safety Engineering students, who visit the lecture
   ``basics of occupational safety{''}. Ninety students attended all steps
   of the experiment (treatment group n = 44; textbook-group n = 46). The
   self-study-video has a significant effect on the increase of knowledge
   and the video-group seems to be more successful than the textbook-group
   in the post-test. However, the self-study-video is not as motivating as
   expected, caused by the design of the self-study-video with a
   computer-generated voice.},

Abstract = {The different types of competences - specific to the subject, specific
   to the degree and cross-curricular - are crucial elements in the degrees
   adapted to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Mechanisms by
   means of which promoting both specific to the degree and specific to the
   subject competences are usually well defined. However, the means to
   acquire cross-curricular competences are more difficult due to the fact
   that they are neither knowledge nor skills belonging to a given subject.
   To contribute to the acquisition of these skills and to foster
   self-learning, we have developed an experience in which, based on the
   use of collaborative tools, students will design, evaluate and share
   video-tutorials on some theoretical or practical subject issues proposed
   by the teachers. In the paper we present some aspects of this
   experience: results of the evaluation pool, rating of the videos on
   Google+ and a comparative analysis of the assessment made by both
   students and teachers.},

Title = {An Improved Inter-Intra Contrastive Learning Framework on
   Self-Supervised Video Representation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {32},
Number = {8},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method
   to learn video feature representations. In traditional self-supervised
   contrastive learning methods, constraints from anchor, positive, and
   negative data pairs are used to train the model. In such a case,
   different samplings of the same video are treated as positives, and
   video clips from different videos are treated as negatives. Because the
   spatio-temporal information is important for video representation, we
   set the temporal constraints more strictly by introducing intra-negative
   samples. In addition to samples from different videos, negative samples
   are extended by breaking temporal relations in video clips from the same
   anchor video. With the proposed Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework,
   we can train spatio-temporal convolutional networks to learn feature
   representations from videos. Strong data augmentations, residual clips,
   as well as head projector are utilized to construct an improved version.
   Three kinds of intra-negative generation functions are proposed and
   extensive experiments using different network backbones are conducted on
   benchmark datasets. Without using pre-computed optical flow data, our
   improved version can outperform previous IIC by a large margin, such as
   19.4\% (from 36.8\% to 56.2\%) and 5.2\% (from 15.5\% to 20.7\%) points
   improvements in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video
   retrieval, respectively. For video recognition, over 3\% points
   improvements can also be obtained on these two benchmark datasets.
   Discussions and visualizations validate that our IICv2 can capture
   better temporal clues and indicate the potential mechanism.},

Title = {Online videos for self-directed second language learning},
Journal = {LANGUAGE LEARNING \& TECHNOLOGY},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion in video content available online.
   Yet there is relatively scant research on if, how, and why second
   language (L2) learners engage with videos in their target language as
   part of their self-directed study-especially for languages with a
   smaller media footprint. This paper presents qualitative findings from a
   longitudinal study of the self-directed study behaviours, collected
   through learning diaries and stimulated recall interviews, of eight
   intermediate-advanced learners of Auslan (Australia Sign Language)
   enrolled at an Australian higher education provider. Findings show that
   our participants were sporadic video watchers, who largely relied on
   YouTube and social media for discovering Auslan content. The lack of an
   Auslan media industry means that online texts were often dry
   informational texts or user-generated content of varied quality and this
   negatively affected some participants motivation for watching. However,
   when they made time to engage with it, participants proved themselves to
   be highly strategic L2 viewers, who used a sophisticated range of
   approaches in comprehending linguistically demanding content.},

Abstract = {Videos are extensively used nowadays to support learners in a variety of
   educational settings such as traditional online courses, MOOCs (Massive
   Open Online Courses), flipped classrooms, and blended courses.
   Therefore, it is of prime importance to develop methodologies capable of
   producing effective video-based learning courses which can lead to the
   highest success and learner satisfaction. AMMIL (Active Meaningful
   Micro-Inductive Learning) is a methodology for creating video-based
   learning courses, which aims to maximise the instructional effectiveness
   in terms of motivation and academic performance in self-learning
   environments. This methodology has been successfully used to create
   several MOOCs, as well as to support a blended programming course at a
   higher education institution. This paper presents the AMMIL methodology
   and an evaluation of two different MOOCs and a higher education
   programming course in which this methodology was applied. This
   evaluation was conducted by using student surveys as data collection
   instruments. The results are very promising since they show that
   students were very satisfied with the courses created applying the AMMIL
   methodology.},

Abstract = {Instructional videos have been widely used in online learning
   environments. Effective video learning requires self-regulation by
   learners, which can be facilitated by deliberate instructional design,
   such as through prompting. Grounded in the interactive, constructive,
   active, and passive (ICAP) framework, this study compared the effects of
   explanation prompts and explored how they affected the retention and
   transfer of learning. In an online experiment, 103 participants were
   randomly assigned to focused self-explanation, scaffolded
   self-explanation, and instructional explanation prompting conditions.
   The results indicated better retention performance from the scaffolded
   prompt than from the focused prompt. No differences were found in
   transfer performance across various forms of prompts. Regression
   analysis suggested that prior knowledge and cognitive load may have
   interacted with the effect of self-explanation prompts. Prior knowledge
   positively predicted transfer performance, and cognitive load negatively
   predicted transfer performance when focused or scaffolded prompts were
   implemented. Potential explanations concerning how self-explanation
   prompts affect learning were discussed.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis emphasizes the importance of Self-Regulated Learning
   (SRL), one of today's most valuable skills, with which learners set
   their learning goals, monitor and control their cognition, motivation,
   and behavior, and reflect upon them. In the current experimental study,
   an intervention program based on short online interactive videos was
   developed to promote SRL skills. This paper presents the impact of the
   intervention on students' use of SRL skills and grades. It also explores
   four key pedagogical processes (teacher-student relationships,
   collaboration, autonomy, and feedback) as mediators for SRL strategies
   use and grades. The experimental and control groups were randomly
   assigned (N = 290 students, 18 classes, grades 7-12). Each teacher
   taught the same subject in two classes for a month, an amount of time
   that allows intervention to take effect. One of the classes participated
   in the video-based intervention program (experimental group), whereas
   the other performed all activities but did not have access to the videos
   (control group). Data was collected through an SRL and pedagogies usage
   questionnaire, SRL video prompts, and knowledge tests and was analyzed
   using the quantitative method. In addition to the theoretical
   contribution, a practical tool has been developed for educators who wish
   to employ online SRL training.},

Title = {Learning Physics Through Online Video Annotations},
Journal = {EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {The support of video in the learning environment is nowadays used to
   many ends, for either for demonstration, research or share. It is
   intended to reinforce the space before and after class and introduce a
   new dynamic and interaction in the classroom itself. Pedagogical
   Innovation may be achieved by different approaches to motivate students
   and obtain better results. The Audiovisual didactic content has been in
   recent years disseminated, in the Physics domain, mainly through YouTube
   platform. Many aspects of video production activities can increase
   students' self-esteem, increase their satisfaction with the learning
   experience, promote a positive attitude towards the subject, provide
   students with lower level of understanding with a broad individual
   tutoring, encouraging students to discuss with each other, exchange
   their opinions, and compare the results of lab activities. On the other
   hand, video can support research activities, offering the researcher
   access to a rich data aggregation to investigate the learning processes.
   This paper presents a revision of the literature about the potential of
   using video annotation in the education context and, perspectives of
   teachers' use of collaborative annotation systems, to promote
   reflection, specifically in the domain of Physics, using an open source
   annotation tool. The creation of audiovisual references, either for
   quick access to parts of organized video annotated content by the
   teacher, knowledge building or revision by and for other students is
   analyzed. This study is complemented with a testbed, showing the
   potential of using audiovisual annotated content, within a k-12 context.
   Students were invited to select video content, annotate, organize and
   publish the annotations, which could support the learning process in the
   domain of Physics. Results show that most of the aspects under analysis
   received a positive evaluation, and students expressed a gain from oral
   lectures and access to new sources of learning. The only exception
   relates to the capacity of the approach to motivated students to the
   study of Physics, as most of the students did not see this methodology
   too much motivating. The impact of this research relates to alternative
   teaching / learning methods, within the Physics' domain, using online
   video annotation, in the support of traditional exposition and
   memorization methodologies.},

Title = {Role of Video Aids in Learning among Higher Education Students: An
   Observational Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCE},

Abstract = {Introduction: Video-based learning is a form of eLearning that allows
   its audience to acquire skills and gain knowledge via video. This method
   of training is becoming increasingly popular, and starting to replace
   the traditional. They improve learner performance by providing visual
   examples, allowing them to interact, explore and digest the content at
   their own pace. The aim is to find the role of video aids for learning
   among the students of higher education.
   Materials and methods: A simple online survey was carried out to
   investigate the role of video aids for learning among the students of
   higher education. 15 self-explanatory questions were framed and
   distributed to the participants through an Online google forms link. The
   data collected in google sheets were transferred to SPSS software.
   Descriptive statistics and Chi- square were carried out.
   Result: The study shows 81\% of students are interested in video
   learning. Most of the males prefer audio quality but females prefer
   visual content of the video. We observed that 36\% of the participants
   preferred Line out videos and 31\% of them preferred ppt videos. Most of
   the students use YouTube for learning, it provides free access to a huge
   volume of educational videos. This service allows users to watch videos
   and post comments and allows registered users to upload videos. 41\% of
   students prefer the duration of the video to be less than 7 min. 32\% of
   students prefer fast explanation in the video and 51\% prefer the normal
   level of speed in video.
   Conclusion: The video aids were found to be very useful to students in
   learning. preference for video aid for learning is high among students
   if the video has good audio quality, visual resolution and simple
   methods of explanation. The study found that video length impacts their
   viewing decision of students indicating that length should play a factor
   in video learning. The video aids have their own advantages as well as
   their disadvantages, which should be considered when choosing the video
   aids.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 21},
Abstract = {A video lesson with generative learning activities has the potential to
   improve learning by engaging learners. However, existing literature
   regarding designing and implementing an interactive video lesson is
   insufficient. In the present study, we aimed to investigate: a) whether
   the use of the summarizing strategy would benefit learning via video
   with regard to learning outcome, cognitive load, intrinsic motivation,
   and metacognition; and b) which self-explanation prompts would further
   engage learners. A total of 149 university students were randomly
   assigned to one of six conditions formed by a 2 X 3 design with
   self-explanation prompts (structured prompts vs. open-ended prompts) and
   summarizing (constructed summarizing vs. provided summarizing vs. no
   summarizing) as the between-subjects factors. Analysis of covariance
   indicated that: a) the structured prompts reduced extraneous cognitive
   load and fostered metacognition, b) the positive effect of the
   structured prompts on retention was dependent upon no summarizing, and
   c) the provided summarizing strategy resulted in higher perceived
   competence when compared to the constructed summarizing strategy. These
   findings are discussed within the contemporary engagement theory and
   cognitive load theory.},

Abstract = {Most traditional science and engineering instructions in universities
   are topic-based and authoritative, and students do not necessarily feel
   the teaching and its content to be personally important or useful.
   Students' science and engineering learning needs to be more personal,
   authentic, and meaningful to them. In reviewing potential technologies
   for achieving such learning benefit, several studies have found that
   video recording of teachers' own teaching practice as well as its
   viewing and sharing support self-reflection and peers critical review.
   As to students, although videos have become essential to many aspects of
   their daily life, little research has related video recording to their
   engineering learning. This study proposes that, as a type of multimedia,
   videos can be used by students to review and reflect their engineering
   knowledge. The video project requires students to use the multimedia
   technology tools to present an engineering topic as a proposed tandem
   learning of both multimedia and engineering courses. That is, students'
   learning of an engineering subject content is embedded into the
   video-making project in a multimedia course. The corresponding learning
   activities is expected to shed a new light on improving engineering
   education.},

Abstract = {Providing feedback in a LMOOC context is challenging. Video feedback has
   the potential to serve online language learners on a large scale, as
   they can download, study, revise these feedback videos repeatedly and
   hopefully transfer their learning to complete future tasks. Vicarious
   learning feedback videos have not been investigated extensively, as most
   previous studies focused on the extent to which feedback receivers can
   learn from their own mistakes and feedback directly addressed to their
   work. The opportunities to learn from others' mistakes and feedback on
   others' work have more significant potential to serve an extensive
   online learning community. This study filled the gap by investigating
   and comparing learners' preferences and the use of two types of
   vicarious learning feedback videos as self-directed learning resources
   in LMOOCs, i.e., teacher and peer feedback videos.
   This study collected both quantitative and qualitative data from 16 s
   language learners. Quantitative data mainly came from the dashboard of a
   learning management system, including frequency (the frequency of each
   video being played) and engagement level (the proportion of each
   feedback video being watched). Qualitative data referred to
   participants' reflections on their learning experiences with these
   videos. The results suggested that 1) teacher feedback videos were
   watched more frequently than others as learners regarded them as their
   desired performance and ultimate learning goals. They preferred
   teachers' explanations of the expected learning outcomes and
   elaborations of marking rubrics in the videos; and 2) the online
   learners watched a much higher percentage of the content in peer
   feedback videos, which indicated a higher engagement level with the peer
   feedback videos than teacher feedback videos. Interview data suggested
   that it was in the peer feedback videos that online students carried out
   more peer evaluation, self-reflection, and assessment practices.},

Title = {Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning by Serial Restoration With
   Elastic Complexity},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {2235-2248},
Abstract = {Self-supervised video representation learning leaves out heavy manual
   annotation by automatically excavating supervisory signals. Although
   contrastive learning based approaches exhibit superior performances,
   pretext task based approaches still deserve further study. This is
   because the pretext tasks exploit the nature of data and encourage
   feature extractors to learn spatiotemporal logic by discovering
   dependencies among video clips or cubes, without manual engineering on
   data augmentations or manual construction of contrastive pairs. To
   utilize chronological property more effectively and efficiently, this
   work proposes a novel pretext task, named serial restoration of shuffled
   clips (SRSC), disentangled by an elaborately designed task network
   composed of an order-aware encoder and a serial restoration decoder. In
   contrast to other order based pretext tasks that formulate clip order
   recognition as a one-step classification problem, the proposed SRSC task
   restores shuffled clips into the right order in multiple steps. Owing to
   the excellent elasticity of SRSC, a novel taxonomy of curriculum
   learning is further proposed to equip SRSC with different pre-training
   strategies. According to the factors that affect the complexity of
   solving the SRSC task, the proposed curriculum learning strategies can
   be categorized into task based, model based and data based. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on the subdivided strategies to explore their
   effectiveness and noteworthy laws. Compared with existing approaches,
   this work demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves
   state-of-the-art performances in pretext task based self-supervised
   video representation learning and a majority of the proposed strategies
   further boost the performance of downstream tasks. For the first time,
   the features pre-trained by the pretext tasks are applied to video
   captioning by feature-level early fusion, and enhance the input of
   existing approaches as a lightweight plugin.},

Abstract = {Self-education corresponds to a quest for knowledge without the need for
   a teacher targeting,which sometimes ends up not allowing students to
   seek their own answers. According to Jacques Ranciere (2017), it is this
   self-education that contributes to the intellectual emancipation of the
   subjects. Starting from a view of the classroom as a space for building
   knowledge, that surpasses the classic vision of school communication, in
   which there is only one transmitter and several receivers, denominated
   by Paulo Freire (2005) of ``Banking Education{''}, happened an
   experience of self-regulation of learning. The activity was developed
   with a group of 36 future teachers of the course Letras, Lingua
   Portuguesa, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil,
   in the Educational Technologies curricular component. The group was
   asked to read the text ``Infancia, midias e aprendizagem: autodidaxia e
   colaboracao{''} (Belloni \& Gomes). Next, in the virtual learning
   environment they should post a link of a video that helped them to
   better understand the proposed theme and the link to a story that covers
   the theme of the text. Then, an explanatory video (like a video lesson)
   of a maximum of 3 minutes was requested, about the text we have been
   studying. The activity was followed by a self-assessment, also available
   in the virtual learning environment. The preparation of the video
   lessons is justified because it is the tool most students use for
   individualized study. The results of the experiment revealed that, by
   having the content studied understandable to others from an audiovisual
   resource with a limited time, future teachers develop the skills of
   analysis and synthesis. Metacognition still contributes to a more
   effective understanding of what is being studied. Future teachers
   conclude that, by making use of this strategy, they enable students to
   develop their intellectual autonomy, in addition to approaching the
   social culture of reference of these subjects, making more meaningful
   what is studied in the school.},

Abstract = {Deaf students have limitations on the sense of hearing, so to grow
   self-learning requires special processes and training. The results of
   the observations at the especialy needs secondary school (Sekolah
   menengah pertama luar biasa negeri/SMPLB-N-in Indosesia) found that one
   of the goals of the SMPLB-N Ungaran was to produce graduates who were
   independent and could live in community life. This study aims to improve
   the learning independence of SMPLB-N Ungaran students by using
   BISINDO-based videos. This video is equipped with sign language that
   makes it easy for students to understand the material being studied. The
   method used is an experiment with the design of single subject A-B
   patterns. A is baseline dan B is Intervention. The data analysis
   technique uses descriptive percentages. BISINDO-based video-assisted
   learning helps students improve self-learning. The increase in the
   learning independence of deaf students from the baseline phase to the
   intervention phase was 2.29 in the high category. The average increase
   in students' self-learning is 46.1\% for the personal aspects of
   attributes, 52.4\% for the aspect process, and 10.2\% for the learning
   context aspect.},

Title = {Motion-guided spatiotemporal multitask feature discrimination for
   self-supervised video representation learning},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Powerful self -supervised representation models are able to step out of
   the traditional supervised paradigm and rely merely on unlabeled data to
   achieve a deep understanding of visual semantic features. However,
   previous approaches may suffer from background scene bias, making it
   difficult to perform a comprehensive exploration of video spatiotemporal
   structure. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a self
   -supervised video representation learning framework of m otion -guided s
   patiotemporal m ultitask f eature d iscrimination (MSMFD). The method
   mainly utilizes the consistency of motion cues between different views
   to guide the model for spatial and temporal feature similarity
   discrimination. Specifically, the model first selects video clips with
   large motion amplitudes based on the collected optical flow maps.
   Subsequently, the model introduces an instance discrimination task for
   overall spatiotemporal structure perception of the video, while a
   shuffled triplet and an augmented quadruple task are created to further
   enhance the exploration of intraframe sequence order and local spatial
   fine-grained. Furthermore, we propose joint motion alignment of spatial,
   temporal, and spatiotemporal dimensions under different views as a
   powerful compensation for acquiring motion features. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our self -supervised method is effective for
   learning video representations and achieves competitive performance in
   action recognition and video retrieval tasks compared to other
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Title = {Navigating virtual english learning horizons:a study on students' use of
   360° videos in self-directedlearning},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 10},
Abstract = {360 degrees videos have yielded satisfactory outcomes in English
   learning. However, there exists a dearth of research that delves into
   the efficacy of these videos for self-directed learning of English. This
   study aimed to investigate the factors that influence students' use of
   360 degrees videos in self-directed learning of English by using the
   integrative model of behavior prediction as the theoretical background.
   The study sample consisted of 457 university students from China. A
   questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire entailed few
   open questions and 26 items distributed among six factors: Attitudes,
   self-efficacy, subjective norms, behavioral intention, self-regulated
   skills, and actual use. SPSS 22.0, JASP, and SmartPLS 4 were used for
   data analysis. The results revealed significant direct effects of
   attitudes and self-efficacy on behavioral intention and direct effects
   of behavioral intention and self-regulated skills on actual behavior.
   However, the results showed that subjective norms and self-regulated
   skills did not have a direct effect on the behavioral intention, and
   that behavioral intention did not affect actual behavior through
   self-regulated skills. The implementation of 360 degrees videos garnered
   interest among students for self-directed learning of English. The
   influence of self-regulatory skills on the utilization of 360 degrees
   videos is noteworthy, as it may contribute to fostering a sense of ease
   and comfort among students and other stakeholders.},

Abstract = {As a professional academic supporting unit of the University, The
   Independent Learning Centre (ILC) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong
   (CUHK) has decided to provide additional support by adding sign language
   interpretation versions and subtitles to the existing self-learning
   videos. Such a project is pioneering in Hong Kong in addressing the
   needs of Special Education Needs (SEN) students. The project aims to
   benefit students with different levels of hearing impairment or other
   SEN as well as general students. While the revised videos will allow and
   encourage a wide range of students with different levels of learning
   difficulties to foster their independent learning skills, the added
   subtitles (Cantonese, Mandarin or English) can aid learning in terms of
   retention, comprehension, accuracy and engagement. Such benefit means
   general students are also expected to have their learning effectiveness
   increased by viewing these inclusive design videos. The whole project
   selected 98 videos from different self-designed online platforms, which
   would be over 10 hours in total. Once ready, the videos will be
   incorporated into the redesigned online platform and revised
   micro-modules accordingly. This paper aims to offer a first-handed and
   thorough perspective on the whole project in order to share the
   experience of supporting SEN and general students by making eLearning
   more accessible. When we are carrying out the project, we hope we can
   further benefit academia by sharing our successful experience. We
   believe the aims of the project can be further extended by sharing our
   experience with our academic peers, that is, our partners.},

Title = {Zwei: A Self-Play Reinforcement Learning Framework for Video
   Transmission Services},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {1350-1365},
Abstract = {Video transmission services adopt adaptive algorithms to ensure users'
   demands. Existing techniques are often optimized and evaluated by a
   function that linearly combines several weighted metrics. Nevertheless,
   we observe that the given function often fails to describe the
   requirement accurately, resulting in the violation of generating the
   required methods. We propose Zwei, a self-play reinforcement learning
   framework that updates the policy by straightforwardly utilizing the
   actual requirement. Technically, Zwei effectively rolls out the
   trajectories from the same initial state, and instantly estimate the win
   rate w.r.t the competition outcome, where the outcome represents which
   trajectory is closer to the assigned requirement. We evaluate Zwei with
   different requirements on various video transmission tasks, including
   adaptive bitrate streaming, crowd-sourced live streaming scheduling, and
   real-time communication. Results indicate that Zwei optimizes itself
   according to the assigned requirement faithfully, outperforming the
   state-of-the-art methods under all considered scenarios. Moreover, we
   further propose Zwei(+), which enables Zwei to learn the policies in the
   vanilla no-regret reinforcement learning scenario. We validate Zwei(+)
   in the adaptive Nitrate streaming task and show the superiority of the
   proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.},
