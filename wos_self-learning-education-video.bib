Abstract = {One of the most important reasons for utilising virtual environments is
   to increase the flexibility of participating in education. Videos are a
   widely utilised technological solution for realising this type of
   flexible education. An educational model that videos are especially well
   suited for is flipped learning. However, the absence of contact teaching
   poses challenges for flipped learning, in which traditionally
   lecture-heavy activities are arranged as self-studies while face-to-face
   classes are used for cooperative studying. This paper examines a
   piloting of flipped learning organised alongside a video-based blended
   education model. The pilot provides experience of how flipped learning
   functions in an educational environment where the flexibility of
   participation is a priority, participation is mostly done asynchronously
   using on-demand videos, and in which students make practically no use of
   contact teaching. Based on the observations, the paper's discussion
   section presents some noteworthy considerations, as well as possible
   solutions for challenges identified during the piloting.},

Title = {Effects of Self-Regulated Learning Prompts at Three Different Phases in
   Video-Based Learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF FORMATIVE DESIGN IN LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 9},
Abstract = {The current study examined the influences of self-regulated learning
   prompts provided during three different self-regulated learning phases
   in video-based learning. A total of 58 college students from a
   midwestern university were randomly assigned into one of the four
   conditions: (1) self-regulated learning prompts at the forethought
   phase, (2) self-regulated learning prompts at the performance phase, (3)
   self-regulated learning prompts at the self-reflection phase, and (4) no
   self-regulated learning prompts in any phase. Participants watched a
   video on the human respiratory system and responded to the
   self-regulated learning prompts in one of the three phases or no
   prompts. Upon completing the video, participants responded to a
   questionnaire assessing their self-regulated learning levels and
   learning outcome. Self-regulated learning levels were also inferred by
   learners' behavior of pausing and rewinding during video-watching.
   Results indicated that participants who received self-regulated learning
   prompts at the performance phase achieved better learning outcome
   compared to those in the no prompt condition.},

Abstract = {This study examined the effects of an integrated approach that combines
   segmentation and self-explanation designs on learner achievement for
   meaningful video-based learning. This was a pretest-posttest research
   design with a sample size of 121 participants randomly assigned to one
   of four different types of video instructions (continuous, segmentation,
   self-explanation, or the combination of segmentation and
   self-explanation). Participants engaged in video instruction that used
   either a continuous video or segmented video clips and incorporated
   either self-explanation prompts or no self-explanation prompts. The
   results showed that participants in the combination and segmentation
   conditions outperformed those in the continuous condition in evaluation
   ability, and participants in the combination condition outperformed
   those in the continuous condition in the overall performance after
   controlling for prior knowledge. The current study indicates that the
   combined design can effectively facilitate student learning by engaging

Title = {The effects of self-controlled video feedback on motor learning and
   self-efficacy in a Physical Education setting: an exploratory study on
   the shot-put},

Volume = {25},

Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Background: Laboratory studies have shown that self-controlled (video)
   feedback benefits motor learning and self-motivational beliefs. These
   outcomes are relevant to Physical Education (PE), but need to be
   verified for PE settings, in which practice and feedback need to be
   organized in large groups rather than individually as is common in
   laboratory studies.Purpose: The main aim of this study was to examine
   the effects of self-controlled video feedback on students' motor
   learning and self-efficacy in a PE setting when students obtain feedback
   relatively independent of the teacher. The secondary aim was to examine
   to what extent self-control and self-efficacy during practice predicted
   students' motor learning.Method: Participants were 56 grade 1 students
   of a regular secondary school who practised the shot-put during four
   practice sessions organized during PE lessons. One class practised with
   self-controlled video feedback (SC-VF group, n=22). They practised
   relatively independent of the teacher: peers filmed each other and
   analysed the recorded video with help from video applications, a video
   model and cue cards. A second class practised in a similar fashion.
   However, they were yoked to the first group and could not choose the
   timing and frequency of feedback delivery (externally controlled video
   feedback, EC-VF group, n=17). A third group practised in a traditional
   way (teacher guided TG group, n=17) with demonstrations, verbal
   instructions and feedback from a PE teacher. Shot-put distance, shot-put
   technique and self-efficacy were measured in a pre- (week 1), post-
   (week 8) and retention (week 9) test. During practice (weeks 2-7,
   including four practice sessions), students rated their self-efficacy.
   After the last practice session, students rated their perceptions
   towards practice (i.e. perceived enjoyment and perceived learning
   effect). Hierarchical two-stepped linear regression analyses were
   performed to explore whether the type of intervention (SC-VF, EC-VF or
   TG group) and self-efficacy during practice predicted motor
   learning.Findings: Results showed that shot-put distance and technique
   increased significantly after practice, without differences between
   groups. Self-efficacy improved significantly after practice for the
   SC-VF (from pre- to retention test) and the TG groups (from pre- to
   post- and retention test), but not for the EC-VF group. Furthermore,
   students in the SC-VF group reported a higher perceived learning effect,
   compared to students in the EC-VF group. No differences in perceived
   enjoyment were found. Finally, self-efficacy during practice predicted
   improvements in shot-put technique from pre- to retention
   test.Conclusion: Self-controlled video feedback without guidance of a
   teacher on movement technique led to similar learning effects as
   traditional guidance of the teacher in a PE context. Self-control of
   feedback delivery (i.e. timing and frequency) seemed to have positive
   effects on self-efficacy and perceived learning effect, but did not lead
   to superior motor learning or perceived enjoyment. This study indicates
   that self-controlled video feedback as applied in this study can be
   implemented in PE. Future research that investigates whether and how the
   application of self-controlled video feedback can be further optimized,
   also for different types of skills, is needed. Furthermore, monitoring
   the application of self-regulatory skills seems important for further
   understanding the effects of self-controlled video feedback.},

Title = {Self-regulated learning support in flipped learning videos enhances
   learning outcomes},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {158},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In flipped learning, students study learning material before class and
   apply the content of the learning material during class. This requires
   self-regulated learning (SRL) behavior due to the increased autonomy in
   this instructional approach. Providing students with video-embedded SRL
   support (i.e., prompts and explicit instruction) during the learning
   activities before class has proven to be an effective strategy in
   primary and higher education to enhance students' SRL and learning
   outcomes. The current study aims to replicate the effects of SRL support
   in a Flipped class in secondary education over the course of eight
   weeks. In total, 115 eighth-grade students from five classes
   participated in a quasi-experimental study, which measured the effects
   of SRL support on students' SRL (self-reports and online activities),
   learning outcomes, and satisfaction. We found a positive effect of SRL
   support on learning outcomes, but we could not explain this by
   differences in students' SRL. Although all the students were generally
   positive about the flipped learning environment, some students clearly
   disliked the SRL instruction. We conclude that SRL support is beneficial
   for students' learning but that it should be carefully designed to avoid
   students' dissatisfaction, which could potentially nullify these
   beneficial effects on learning.},

   Chemistry subjects, at Pharmacy Grade (University of Seville) in order
   to promote the development of relevant competences. Furthermore, the
   self-production of laboratory experience-based videos that can be

Pages = {51155-51166},
Abstract = {YouTube provides a vital source for self-directed learning. YouTube's
   search engine, however, ranks videos according to popularity, relevancy,
   and view history rather than quality. The effect of this ranking on
   learners' behavior and experience is not clear: Do learners tend to
   choose from the top of the returned search list? Does the choosing
   behavior affect their learning? Is the type of sought knowledge relevant
   in this process? To answer these questions, we conducted two experiments
   with sophomore-level students in electrical and computer engineering
   programs. The students were asked to learn about two new topics by
   watching YouTube videos of their choice. The first topic conveys
   procedural knowledge about using the Quine McCluskey algorithm for
   minimizing logical functions. The second topic relates to the concept of
   the set-reset latch. In each learning session, the students had to
   report their watching behavior and experience by responding to an online
   questionnaire as well as to solve a problem related to the respective
   topic. The results show a clear tendency to choose from the top of the
   returned list. However, students' performance in problem-solving was
   found to be uncorrelated with the choosing behavior. These results were
   similar for procedural and conceptual learning although the students'
   performance in solving the conceptual problem was significantly lower.
   These findings indicate that university students who seek YouTube for
   self-directed learning can freely choose from the top of the returned
   search list without concern. There is no evident harm in doing so.
   However, students need to be thoughtful when using YouTube for
   conceptual learning. They should use different strategies such as
   watching multiple videos, selecting videos with higher viewer ratings,
   or watching videos with related procedural knowledge to support the
   learning of new concepts.},

Title = {Peer Assessment and Video Feedback for Fostering Self, Co, and Shared
   Regulation of Learning in a Higher Education Language Classroom},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Self-regulated learning includes the cognitive, metacognitive,
   behavioral, motivational, and affective aspects of learning. The
   conceptualization of self and socially regulated learning has recently
   received much attention and peer assessment has been found to increase
   the use of metacognitive activity. The present exploratory qualitative
   study aimed to identify self-, co-, and socially shared regulatory
   processes in an oral English as a Foreign Language task. The regulatory
   activity deployed by 10 learners was studied within the context of a
   peer assessment task using an assessment form paired with video feedback
   in the context of an English language classroom at a French university.
   These interactions were filmed and discussed in individual
   self-confrontation interviews which were analyzed through inductive
   coding. Specific findings from the classroom setting shed light on
   existing gaps in the literature. First, students can gain confidence in
   their own skills through assessing their peers and activating regulatory
   processes both individually and as a group. Second, appropriate tools
   can increase co-regulated and socially regulated learning through the
   structuring of cooperative regulatory behaviors. Third, psychological
   safety appeared to be a propitious social context for supporting
   regulated learning (SRL, CoRL, and SSRL). We also shed light on the fact
   that adaptive regulatory strategies are present in oral (as well as
   written) English as a Foreign Language tasks. These results indicate the
   potential for learning situations based on video feedback used in
   conjunction with peer assessment and collaborative learning in order to
   develop regulatory behaviors in language learners.},

Abstract = {The Fourth Industrial Age (4IA) is likely to be accompanied

   This study investigates the potential of vicarious teaming from videoed

   Undergraduate Business students observed videos of student tutees
   responding to tutor prompts as they tackled openended and conceptually
   challenging problems. The results revealed that student observers
   self-reported: gains in their conceptual understanding from watching
   videoed tutorials; preferences for watching tutorial dialogues over
   alternative learning methods; and that watching videoed tutorials had
   positive impacts on their affect and access to additional
   learning-related information. The study concludes that vicarious teaming
   from videoed tutorials is an accessible technology-mediated pedagogy
   that is achievable by mainstream educators and is effective in
   developing conceptual understanding, engaging students and providing

Abstract = {We propose a self-supervised method to learn feature representations
   from videos. A standard approach in traditional self-supervised methods
   uses positive-negative data pairs to train with contrastive learning
   strategy. In such a case, different modalities of the same video are
   treated as positives and video clips from a different video are treated
   as negatives. Because the spatio-temporal information is important for
   video representation, we extend the negative samples by introducing
   intra-negative samples, which are transformed from the same anchor video
   by breaking temporal relations in video clips. With the proposed
   Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework, we can train spatio-temporal
   convolutional networks to learn video representations. There are many
   flexible options in our IIC framework and we conduct experiments by
   using several different configurations. Evaluations are conducted on
   video retrieval and video recognition tasks using the learned video
   representation. Our proposed IIC outperforms current state-of-the-art
   results by a large margin, such as 16.7\% and 9.5\% points improvements
   in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video retrieval,
   respectively. For video recognition, improvements can also be obtained
   on these two benchmark datasets. Code is available at https:

Abstract = {Video in education has become pervasive. Globally, educators are
   recording instructional videos to augment their students' learning and,
   in many contexts, replace face-to-face lectures. However, the mere act
   of watching a video is primarily a passive learning experience likely
   leading to lack of student engagement hindering learning. Active
   learning strategies such as video annotations and in-video questions
   have the potential to shift the passive experience of watching an
   instructional video to a more active one by engaging students with
   learning strategies designed to promote self-regulated learning and
   improve content knowledge. This experimental study investigates the
   impact of in-video questions compared to video annotations on learning
   and self-efficacy in an experimental setting. Findings revealed that
   learners who annotated videos had higher self-efficacy than those who
   completed in-video questions likely due to the immediate feedback
   received from the in-video questions. The study further concluded that
   prior knowledge plays a critical role in selecting appropriate active
   learning strategies, suggesting that video annotations be considered
   when students have prior knowledge about a topic whereas in-video
   questions with immediate feedback be interspersed in videos when
   students do not have prior knowledge about a topic.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a survey on video games in learning and education,
   including patterns and trends in technologies and correlations in
   popularity with regard to the entertainment industry. The fact that
   games have the ability to engage and captivate a person's attention for
   long periods of time, while offering numerous additional benefits, such
   as, developing high-level thinking skills, is extremely attractive and
   important. The capacity to unconsciously learn and master complex
   concepts through video games has enormous benefit in learning (beyond
   simple `educational' games, such as, sharpening focus, responsiveness,
   and collaborative working). As we show in this paper, research dating
   right back to the early 1980s has consistently demonstrated that playing
   computer games (irrespective of genre) develops faster reaction times,
   improved hand-eye co-ordination and raises players' self-esteem. We
   review video game literature in the area of education (and learning) and
   how technologies are changing traditional learning paradigms (e.g.,
   mobile devices and virtual reality). What is more, we also review the
   disadvantages of video games in certain contexts and debate the reasons
   for their failures - but more importantly what measures are necessary to
   ensure video games facilitate as an educational `aid' and not a
   `hindrance'. Having said that, we deliberate on questions, such as, what
   makes an `educational game' and how is the design and structure
   different from a traditional `video game'? Above all, educational video
   games have changed enormously over the past few decades, with a greater
   emphasis on understanding the audience, learning objectives and
   evaluation mechanisms to `guarantee' the game is successful and
   accomplishes its end goal - as we discuss, this is embodied by a whole
   assortment of elements, from psychology, age, gender and technological
   factors to social and usability development. In conclusion, video games
   connect with a vast assortment of areas, such as, medicine and robotics,
   but most importantly, education and learning. With video games one of
   the largest growing sectors, we contemplate how past research and recent
   developments in technologies are changing the learning and educational
   sector for the better, thereby gaining insights into future strength and
   directions.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 18},
Abstract = {Parallel to the tremendous growth and expansion of video technology, it
   is easy and enjoyable for students to create a video as a learning
   activity. However, most previous studies primarily focused on
   declarative knowledge learning (e.g., language learning, science
   learning) rather than motor skill learning. The current study aimed to
   investigate whether creating and sharing a video with classmates would
   be more effective than merely creating a video and self-exercise to
   learn a motor skill in terms of intrinsic motivation, perseverance in
   learning, learning satisfaction, and roller-skating skill. Partially
   consistent with our hypothesis, we found that creating and sharing a
   video with classmates increased students' intrinsic motivation,
   perseverance in motor tasks, and learning satisfaction, but not
   roller-skating skill, followed by merely creating a video and then
   self-exercise. The findings have an important implication for motor
   skills learning: during teaching motor skills, teachers can use
   encourage students to create and share a video with classmates as a
   homework activity to increase students' intrinsic motivation,
   perseverance in motor tasks, and learning satisfaction.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate student-created video as an
   active learning approach in an online environment to inform
   instructional practices of student-created video in STEM. Data analyzed
   in this study included pre-service teachers N = 107, 1-minute videos and
   pre- and post surveys. The findings of this qualitative study indicated
   that student-created video was an active learning activity that
   contributed to an increase in students' perceived STEM content
   knowledge, improved perceptions of self-efficacy, and evidence of
   student engagement inclusive of behavioral, affective, and cognitive
   domains. Themes derived from the participants' perceptions included:
   perceived self-efficacy, novelty or usefulness of creating short video,
   time to design and create video, and content and technical knowledge.
   Student-created video as an active approach to learning can be included
   in STEM education to increase STEM knowledge and foster integrative
   twenty-first Century skills. Practical implications for educators when
   designing student-created video assignments include (a) following a
   video development model; (b) providing extra time for content
   acquisition and revisions; and (c) incorporating peer evaluations.},

Abstract = {This article describes a study on the use of learning videos in
   handicraft technologies for adult interests' education. Working with
   adults with different learning rate and different previously acquired
   knowledge, the use of learning videos, that include visible handicraft
   technology demonstration step-by-step, provides improvement of adult
   education. The aim of this study is to explore and justify the need of
   the use of learning video for adult interests' education, learning the
   fine handicraft technology from Deco Clay polymer. Pedagogical
   experiment was carried., out in Latvia University of Agriculture in
   Institute of Education and Home Economics and in the flower formation
   studio `Madeira Flowerland' in Jelgava, interviewing studio
   participants. It was studied how the use of learning video promotes
   precise learning of the exact flower-making technology. The criteria for
   assessing the use of learning video were set up. The materials of
   learning videos for handicraft technology from Japan Deco Clay polymer
   for adult interests' education were developed and tested in practice.
   Basic principles of adult education were applied through the process of
   using the learning videos (continuing education accessibility,
   connectivity with the own' experience, ``learning by doing{''}); as well
   as adult education favourable didactic elements (learning in their own
   home and at the individual rate); individual develops skills to see the
   proportions, to perceive space, to create flower compositions and
   improves information technology skills. As a result individual's
   horizons expanded and personal development took place. Usage of learning
   video creates the conditions that supports relation between individual's
   autonomy and competence with her/his own experience, encourages
   creativity, motivation and personal development during learning process,
   thus improving learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Person re-identification is an important task in video surveillance,
   focusing on finding the same person across different cameras. However,
   most existing methods of video-based person re-identification still have
   some limitations (e.g., the lack of effective deep learning framework,
   the robustness of the model, and the same treatment for all video
   frames) which make them unable to achieve better recognition
   performance. In this paper, we propose a novel self-paced learning
   algorithm for video-based person re-identification, which could
   gradually learn from simple to complex samples for a mature and stable
   model. Self-paced learning is employed to enhance video based person
   re-identification based on deep neural network, so that deep neural
   network and self-paced learning are unified into one frame. Then, based
   on the trained self-paced learning, we propose to employ deep
   reinforcement learning to discard misleading and confounding frames and
   find the most representative frames from video pairs. With the advantage
   of deep reinforcement learning, our method can learn strategies to
   select the optimal frame groups. Experiments show that the proposed
   framework outperforms the existing methods on the iLIDS-VID, PRID-2011
   and MARS datasets.},

Title = {Self-explanation prompts in video learning: an optimization study},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 27},
Abstract = {The self-explanation strategy motivates learners to actively select and
   integrate information, thereby fostering meaningful learning. To
   generate comprehensive and insightful explanations, learners often
   require support. However, there is a limited understanding of the
   optimal form of self-explanation that effectively assists learners in
   applying this strategy in video learning environments. This study tests
   various self-explanation prompts, using multiple indicators, including
   learning outcomes, cognitive load, intrinsic motivation, and engagement,
   to measure effects. Participants (n = 143) were randomly assigned to
   five conditions: No Strategy, Focused, Visual Scaffold, Fill-in-blank
   Scaffold, and Rewrite Scaffold. Results indicate that scaffolded
   self-explanation prompts enhance learning performance and notably reduce
   cognitive load, with the Fill-in-blank scaffold demonstrating
   significant advantages. However, the impact on intrinsic motivation and
   engagement is not clearly pronounced. To optimize self-explanation
   strategy's effectiveness, it is recommended to provide tailored support
   based on content difficulty and learners' proficiency levels,
   facilitating active participation at a balanced cognitive load level.},

Title = {Curiosity in Online Video Concept Learning and Short-Term Outcomes in
   Blended Medical Education},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {8},
Month = {NOV 5},
Abstract = {Background: A student's level of curiosity in a subject after learning
   about it through online videos has not been addressed well in the
   medical education field. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to
   investigate online learning's effect on the stimulation of curiosity and
   short-term learning outcomes in a blended framework of precision medical
   education.Methods: A mixed-methods research design was used. During the
   2020 academic year, all fifth-year medical students who, prior to class,
   viewed 6 video clips that presented 6 core concepts were invited to
   complete a survey and self-reflection on their learning process to
   assess their level of curiosity in each concept. For each group of
   medical students, teaching assistants helped collect anonymous survey
   data and summative assessment scores representing the students' learning
   outcomes. Video-viewing patterns, attained through an action log
   transformation, were also coded for analysis. Mann-Whitney U and
   Kruskal-Wallis tests were employed to compare differences between
   groups, and multiple linear regression was used to select the factors
   affecting learning outcomes. Qualitative data were content-coded through
   a descriptive approach using thematic analysis.Results: Of 142 medical
   students, 136 watched the online videos, 124 responded to the
   questionnaires, and 92 provided comments. Students' curiosity levels
   after learning about each concept through online videos significantly
   correlated with the degree to which a concept was learned. Medical
   students spent a median of 1.6 h online, and pause frequency correlated
   with curiosity in certain concepts. Aroused curiosity was associated
   with short-term learning outcomes in inconsistent effect sizes and
   directions. Students' feedback revealed various dimensions of curiosity,
   including novelty acknowledgment, recognition of an information gap, and
   information-seeking requests.Conclusions: Curiosity can be induced
   through online video learning platforms and has a role in short-term
   learning outcomes in medical education.},

Title = {Effect of self-learning media based on 360° virtual reality for learning
   periodontal instrument skills},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Introduction Of 360 degrees Virtual Reality (VR) is possibly produced
   and sufficiently effective as a consumer-friendly VR learning medium.
   Therefore, it is also expected to be useful in the dental practice
   field, as a self-learning medium for non-face-to-face skill training
   during the ongoing pandemic (COVID-19). Accordingly, this study was
   conducted to assess 360 degrees VR self-learning media for a periodontal
   instrument operation. Materials and Methods We recruited 30 participants
   who had never experienced instrument training. We offered basic
   education and initial assessment (IA), then divided them into three
   groups: 1) PAPER: trained only with paper handouts; 2) 2D: trained with
   2D video; 3) VR: trained with 360 degrees VR. Each group performed
   self-learning and mid-term assessment (MA). Subjects then implemented
   home self-learning with the same media for one week, which was then
   followed by a final assessment (FA). Result Analysis of IA-to-FA
   improvement scores showed that VR and 2D video were significantly higher
   than the PAPER groups. Meanwhile, analysis of MA-to-FA improvement
   scores showed that only VR was substantially higher than the PAPER
   group. Although VR and 2D video groups were not considerably different,
   VR scores were numerically higher than 2D video in all improvement score
   analyses. Discussion Both 2D video and 360 degrees VR training were
   helpful to participants for an effective self-learning and also had good
   portability and accessibility as online-based learning methods. 360
   degrees VR showed higher learning efficiency than regular 2D video,
   possibly due to its autonomy, 360 degrees visual information and
   physical and immersive characteristics, which positively affected
   self-training. Conclusion Our findings showed the potential of 360
   degrees VR learning media and, further, suggest its usefulness as a
   novel self-learning method in future dental education.},

Abstract = {The self-paced nature of asynchronous online learning (AOL) is
   recognized as an obstacle that disrupts student success in the learning
   environment. Without on-time interventions provided by instructors,
   students find it challenging to use learning strategies tailored to the
   learning environment, and their use of self-regulated learning (SRL)
   strategies has been regarded one of the key indicators of success in
   AOL. To examine how student SRL strategies are associated with their
   video engagement trajectory and learning outcomes, we used student video
   engagement data collected at multiple time points. Participants were 159
   students who were taking a self-paced asynchronous online statistics
   course. Results revealed that student video engagement was found to
   increase over time and student management strategies contributed to the
   upward change. We also found that the growth of engagement predicted
   student achievement in the course. Our findings shed light on
   instructional strategies to support students in AOL contexts.},

Abstract = {This study aims to design a video-based learning environment using
   workflow and scaffolding to enhance self-instructional video production
   ability of pre-service teacher and to explore the impacts of the use of
   the designed video-based learning environment on learning. The
   methodology was divided into two main phases. In the first phase, a
   video-based learning environment was designed using workflow and
   scaffolding. In the second phase, the impacts of the use of the
   developed video-based learning environment on learning were
   investigated. The samples were 47 undergraduate students at the School
   of Education, University of Phayao. The results were, as follows: (a)
   The design draft of the developed video-based learning environment was
   appropriate, and the revision was made according to six criteria: (1)
   instructional media, (2) content, (3) learning activities, (4)
   communication devices, (5) learning management systems, and (6) screen
   design. The analysis of related studies and documents, the instructional
   video production process consisted of three steps: (1) design, (2)
   development, and (3) video delivery. (b) The comparison of scores on the
   instructional video production knowledge test revealed that the
   pre-service teachers' average post-test score was higher than the
   average pre-test score with a statistically significant difference at
   the .05 level. The assessment of instructional videos, it was found that
   the pre-service teachers in the field of humanities obtained a higher
   score than those in the field of science. Male pre-service teachers
   received a higher score than female pre-service teachers. The average
   suit-ability score indicated the overall appropriateness of the
   developed video-based learning environment.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTIC RESEARCH},

Abstract = {Purpose: The aim of this research was to evaluate the effectiveness of a
   clinical instructional video with a structured worksheet for independent
   self-study in a complete denture program.
   Methods: 47 multilingual dental students completed a task by watching an
   instructional video with subtitles regarding clinical complete denture
   procedures. After completion, students evaluated their learning
   experience, and 11 students participated in focus group interviews to
   gain further insight. A mixed-methods approach to data collection and
   analysis provided descriptive statistical results and a grounded theory
   approach to coding identified key concepts and categories from the
   qualitative data.
   Results: Over 70\% of students had favorable opinions of the learning
   experience and indicated that the speed and length of the video were
   appropriate. Highly positive and conflicting negative comments regarding
   the use of subtitles showed both preferences for subtitles over audio
   and vice versa. The use of a video resource was considered valuable as
   the replay and review functions allowed better visualization of the
   procedures, which was considered a good recap tool for the clinical
   demonstration. It was also a better revision aid than textbooks. So, if
   the students were able to view these videos at will, they believed that
   videos supplemented their self-study. Despite the positive response,
   videos were not considered to replace live clinical demonstrations.
   Conclusions: While students preferred live demonstrations over the
   clinical videos they did express a realization of these as a
   supplemental learning material for self-study based on their ease of
   access, use for revision, and prior to clinical preparation. (C) 2015

Abstract = {This study focused on the implementation of case-based teaching videos
   on e-learning platform and the effect of these videos on the
   self-regulated learning outcomes of students in a community work course.
   The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between
   students' learning behaviors and self-regulated learning and the effect
   of students' self-regulated learning on their learning performance. This
   study employed a pre-experiment and a single-group, posttest design with
   a 4-month research period. The research participants were 44 social work
   students of a community work course at a university in Taiwan. The
   results of this study indicated that in self-regulated learning,
   case-based teaching videos had a positive effect on the learning
   motivation of all students and the information processing of students
   who achieved high scores in the final exam. Viewing case-based teaching
   videos enhanced the students' academic performance. When the videos
   matched the personal experience of and aroused empathy among the
   students, their learning motivation increased. Academic performance
   improved when the videos were linked to practical experience, clarified
   confusing concepts, and could be watched multiple times. Discussions and
   suggestions regarding the design of case-based teaching videos and the
   relationship between students' learning behaviors and self-regulated
   learning are presented.},

Title = {How can video feedback be used in physical education to support novice
   learning in gymnastics? Effects on motor learning, self-assessment and
   motivation},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {23},
Number = {6},
Pages = {559-574},
Month = {NOV 2},
Abstract = {Background: Much of the existing research concerning the use of video
   feedback (VFB) to enhance motor learning has been undertaken under
   strictly controlled experimental conditions. Few studies have sought to
   explore the impact of VFB on the skill learning experience of the
   students in a structured, school-based physical education (PE) setting.
   Most of those studies have only used qualitative approaches to implicate
   the potential value of VFB to enhance skill acquisition, students'
   engagement or self-assessment ability. Using a quantitative approach,
   the aim of this study was to investigate effects of using VFB on motor
   skill acquisition, self-assessment ability and motivation in a
   school-based learning environment (structured PE programme) with novice
   children learning a gymnastic skill. Method: Two French classes of
   beginners took part in a typical five-week learning programme in
   gymnastics. During each of the five, weekly lessons participants carried
   out the same warm-up routine and exercises. The experimental group (10
   girls - 8 boys, 12.4 +/- 0.5 years) received VFB intermittently when
   learning a front handstand to flat back landing. VFB was given after
   every five attempts, combined with self-assessment and verbal
   instructions from the teacher. The control group (12 girls - 13 boys,
   12.6 +/- 0.4 years) received exactly the same training but was not given
   VFB. In order to assess progress in motor skills, the arm-trunk angle
   (hand-shoulder-hip) was measured in the sagittal plane just as the hips
   formed a vertical line with the shoulders. Motivation was assessed using
   the Situational Motivation Scale questionnaire (Guay, F., R. J.
   Vallerand, and C. Blanchard. 2000. ``On the Assessment of Situational
   Intrinsic and Extrinsic Motivation: The Situational Motivation Scale
   (SIMS).{''} Motivation and Emotion 24 (3): 175-213), and self-assessment
   ability was measured by self-perception task scores. Results:
   Statistical analysis of arm-trunk angle values showed significant
   differences only for the VFB group between the fifth lesson and all
   other lessons. Between lessons 4 and 5, the arm-trunk angle value
   increased significantly from 146.6 +/- 16.9 degrees to 161.2 +/- 14.2
   degrees (p < .001; ES = 0.94). Self-assessment scores improved
   significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1 and lesson 2 (p < 0.01,
   ES = 1.79) and between lesson 4 to lesson 5 (p < .01, ES = 0.94).
   Amotivation decreased significantly for the VFB group between lesson 1
   and lesson 5 (3.06 +/- 1.42 vs. 2.12 +/- 0.62, p < .001, ES = -0.89).
   Discussion/conclusion: Our quantitative data, identifying key movement
   changes as a function of experience in a structured PE programme, were
   congruent with outcomes of previous qualitative research supporting the
   role of VFB. This study highlights the potential relevance of using VFB
   in fostering motor learning, motivation and self-assessment during a PE
   programme with young children. Future pedagogical research is needed to
   examine the ways students could use VFB technology for greater
   self-regulation, with the potential to deliver appropriate movement
   feedback, based on different levels of experience in students.},

Abstract = {Building the general feature from unlabeled videos is the core of
   self-supervised video representation learning. However, recent research
   on video representation focuses on static visual pixel information,
   which makes these models unable to capture the dynamics in the temporal
   dimension. In order to solve the aforementioned issue and improve the
   generalization of the model, we propose an enhanced motion visual cue
   (EMVC) method for self-supervised video representation learning to
   reduce the background bias and increase the motion information. Our EMVC
   includes a background replacing module and a foreground fixing module
   that leverages the foreground and background of the original video
   sequence to make the background of same-action videos less identical and
   their motion cues more distinct. Experimental results show that the
   proposed method effectively reduces the biases in the background and
   significantly improves the video's ability to comprehend motion
   information, leading to an increase in recognition accuracy.
   Specifically, the EMVC method achieved an accuracy of 84.6\%, 53.1\%,
   and 68.3\% on the UCF101, HMDB51, and Diving48 datasets, respectively,
   outperforming the existing algorithms. Additionally, significant
   improvements were obtained in the video retrieval task on benchmark
   datasets, with an average improvement of over 14.6\%.},

Abstract = {Video modeling is a type of observational learning that can influence
   students' motor skill development. The present study was designed to
   investigate the influence of video modeling on students' self-regulation
   in physical education classes. Two classes of 45 students (24 boys and
   21 girls) aged 8 years were randomly assigned into two groups: the class
   that observed a video of an expert model performing the kick was the
   video modeling group; and the class that observed their teacher's
   performance was the live modeling group. Students were taught football
   skills, twice a week for four weeks. Before and after the intervention,
   students had to perform a kick in a soccer box. The use of
   self-regulation strategies during the tests was assessed through
   structured interview questions after performances. The statistical
   analysis showed that both groups developed their self-regulation
   abilities. The results of this study suggest that video modeling
   improves self-regulation in children and should be used by
   practitioners.},

Abstract = {This research investigated the details and effects of a short online
   Professional Learning Program designed to develop teacher education
   students' knowledge about how to promote self-regulated learning (SRL)
   in the classroom. The Program was based on a new framework for how
   teachers can promote SRL, the SRL Teacher Promotion Framework (SRL-TPF),
   which focused on the promotion of SRL strategies, students' knowledge
   about learning, and students' metacognition. It consisted of seven
   modules describing the different SRL promotion types and SRL
   capabilities and ways to promote them through teacher talk and action.
   Modules included written information and video examples taken from
   observations of real classrooms, which were used to illustrate the
   transfer of SRL theory to instructional practice. Each module concluded
   with several assessment items. During the Program the participants, 91
   teacher education students, were asked to use a simplified scoring
   system based on the SRL-TPF to code lesson transcripts taken from
   classroom observations. The results showed that by the end of the
   program over 85\% of the participants were able to provide teacher
   instructions that included explicit SRL promotion and/or promoted
   students' SRL knowledge. Our study contributes to research findings on
   teacher education students' knowledge of SRL, their promotion of SRL to
   students, and the contribution of short duration SRL professional
   development.},

Abstract = {Several publications claim positive effects of learning videos - in

   on digital transformation, this paper will consider a self-study-video
   in the field of university education. The content of the investigated
   self-study-video is a central model of occupational safety: the design
   model of protective measures. The presented short intervention was
   designed as self-study-video based on an existing textbook chapter.
   Besides the evaluation of design elements, it was investigated which
   effects learning videos may have on the motivation and learning
   performance of students learning the design model. Students of the
   University of Wuppertal were the sample for the intervention. The study
   population were Safety Engineering students, who visit the lecture
   ``basics of occupational safety{''}. Ninety students attended all steps
   of the experiment (treatment group n = 44; textbook-group n = 46). The
   self-study-video has a significant effect on the increase of knowledge
   and the video-group seems to be more successful than the textbook-group
   in the post-test. However, the self-study-video is not as motivating as
   expected, caused by the design of the self-study-video with a
   computer-generated voice.},

Abstract = {The different types of competences - specific to the subject, specific
   to the degree and cross-curricular - are crucial elements in the degrees
   adapted to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA). Mechanisms by
   means of which promoting both specific to the degree and specific to the
   subject competences are usually well defined. However, the means to
   acquire cross-curricular competences are more difficult due to the fact
   that they are neither knowledge nor skills belonging to a given subject.
   To contribute to the acquisition of these skills and to foster
   self-learning, we have developed an experience in which, based on the
   use of collaborative tools, students will design, evaluate and share
   video-tutorials on some theoretical or practical subject issues proposed
   by the teachers. In the paper we present some aspects of this
   experience: results of the evaluation pool, rating of the videos on
   Google+ and a comparative analysis of the assessment made by both
   students and teachers.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a self-supervised contrastive learning method
   to learn video feature representations. In traditional self-supervised
   contrastive learning methods, constraints from anchor, positive, and
   negative data pairs are used to train the model. In such a case,
   different samplings of the same video are treated as positives, and
   video clips from different videos are treated as negatives. Because the
   spatio-temporal information is important for video representation, we
   set the temporal constraints more strictly by introducing intra-negative
   samples. In addition to samples from different videos, negative samples
   are extended by breaking temporal relations in video clips from the same
   anchor video. With the proposed Inter-Intra Contrastive (IIC) framework,
   we can train spatio-temporal convolutional networks to learn feature
   representations from videos. Strong data augmentations, residual clips,
   as well as head projector are utilized to construct an improved version.
   Three kinds of intra-negative generation functions are proposed and
   extensive experiments using different network backbones are conducted on
   benchmark datasets. Without using pre-computed optical flow data, our
   improved version can outperform previous IIC by a large margin, such as
   19.4\% (from 36.8\% to 56.2\%) and 5.2\% (from 15.5\% to 20.7\%) points
   improvements in top-1 accuracy on UCF101 and HMDB51 datasets for video
   retrieval, respectively. For video recognition, over 3\% points
   improvements can also be obtained on these two benchmark datasets.
   Discussions and visualizations validate that our IICv2 can capture
   better temporal clues and indicate the potential mechanism.},

Abstract = {Recent years have seen an explosion in video content available online.
   Yet there is relatively scant research on if, how, and why second
   language (L2) learners engage with videos in their target language as
   part of their self-directed study-especially for languages with a
   smaller media footprint. This paper presents qualitative findings from a
   longitudinal study of the self-directed study behaviours, collected
   through learning diaries and stimulated recall interviews, of eight
   intermediate-advanced learners of Auslan (Australia Sign Language)
   enrolled at an Australian higher education provider. Findings show that
   our participants were sporadic video watchers, who largely relied on
   YouTube and social media for discovering Auslan content. The lack of an
   Auslan media industry means that online texts were often dry
   informational texts or user-generated content of varied quality and this
   negatively affected some participants motivation for watching. However,
   when they made time to engage with it, participants proved themselves to
   be highly strategic L2 viewers, who used a sophisticated range of
   approaches in comprehending linguistically demanding content.},

Abstract = {Videos are extensively used nowadays to support learners in a variety of
   educational settings such as traditional online courses, MOOCs (Massive
   Open Online Courses), flipped classrooms, and blended courses.
   Therefore, it is of prime importance to develop methodologies capable of
   producing effective video-based learning courses which can lead to the
   highest success and learner satisfaction. AMMIL (Active Meaningful
   Micro-Inductive Learning) is a methodology for creating video-based
   learning courses, which aims to maximise the instructional effectiveness
   in terms of motivation and academic performance in self-learning
   environments. This methodology has been successfully used to create
   several MOOCs, as well as to support a blended programming course at a
   higher education institution. This paper presents the AMMIL methodology
   and an evaluation of two different MOOCs and a higher education
   programming course in which this methodology was applied. This
   evaluation was conducted by using student surveys as data collection
   instruments. The results are very promising since they show that
   students were very satisfied with the courses created applying the AMMIL
   methodology.},

Abstract = {Instructional videos have been widely used in online learning
   environments. Effective video learning requires self-regulation by
   learners, which can be facilitated by deliberate instructional design,
   such as through prompting. Grounded in the interactive, constructive,
   active, and passive (ICAP) framework, this study compared the effects of
   explanation prompts and explored how they affected the retention and
   transfer of learning. In an online experiment, 103 participants were
   randomly assigned to focused self-explanation, scaffolded
   self-explanation, and instructional explanation prompting conditions.
   The results indicated better retention performance from the scaffolded
   prompt than from the focused prompt. No differences were found in
   transfer performance across various forms of prompts. Regression
   analysis suggested that prior knowledge and cognitive load may have
   interacted with the effect of self-explanation prompts. Prior knowledge
   positively predicted transfer performance, and cognitive load negatively
   predicted transfer performance when focused or scaffolded prompts were
   implemented. Potential explanations concerning how self-explanation
   prompts affect learning were discussed.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 crisis emphasizes the importance of Self-Regulated Learning
   (SRL), one of today's most valuable skills, with which learners set
   their learning goals, monitor and control their cognition, motivation,
   and behavior, and reflect upon them. In the current experimental study,
   an intervention program based on short online interactive videos was
   developed to promote SRL skills. This paper presents the impact of the
   intervention on students' use of SRL skills and grades. It also explores
   four key pedagogical processes (teacher-student relationships,
   collaboration, autonomy, and feedback) as mediators for SRL strategies
   use and grades. The experimental and control groups were randomly
   assigned (N = 290 students, 18 classes, grades 7-12). Each teacher
   taught the same subject in two classes for a month, an amount of time
   that allows intervention to take effect. One of the classes participated
   in the video-based intervention program (experimental group), whereas
   the other performed all activities but did not have access to the videos
   (control group). Data was collected through an SRL and pedagogies usage
   questionnaire, SRL video prompts, and knowledge tests and was analyzed
   using the quantitative method. In addition to the theoretical
   contribution, a practical tool has been developed for educators who wish
   to employ online SRL training.},

Title = {Learning Physics Through Online Video Annotations},
Journal = {EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {21},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {The support of video in the learning environment is nowadays used to
   many ends, for either for demonstration, research or share. It is
   intended to reinforce the space before and after class and introduce a
   new dynamic and interaction in the classroom itself. Pedagogical
   Innovation may be achieved by different approaches to motivate students
   and obtain better results. The Audiovisual didactic content has been in
   recent years disseminated, in the Physics domain, mainly through YouTube
   platform. Many aspects of video production activities can increase
   students' self-esteem, increase their satisfaction with the learning
   experience, promote a positive attitude towards the subject, provide
   students with lower level of understanding with a broad individual
   tutoring, encouraging students to discuss with each other, exchange
   their opinions, and compare the results of lab activities. On the other
   hand, video can support research activities, offering the researcher
   access to a rich data aggregation to investigate the learning processes.
   This paper presents a revision of the literature about the potential of
   using video annotation in the education context and, perspectives of
   teachers' use of collaborative annotation systems, to promote
   reflection, specifically in the domain of Physics, using an open source
   annotation tool. The creation of audiovisual references, either for
   quick access to parts of organized video annotated content by the
   teacher, knowledge building or revision by and for other students is
   analyzed. This study is complemented with a testbed, showing the
   potential of using audiovisual annotated content, within a k-12 context.
   Students were invited to select video content, annotate, organize and
   publish the annotations, which could support the learning process in the
   domain of Physics. Results show that most of the aspects under analysis
   received a positive evaluation, and students expressed a gain from oral
   lectures and access to new sources of learning. The only exception
   relates to the capacity of the approach to motivated students to the
   study of Physics, as most of the students did not see this methodology
   too much motivating. The impact of this research relates to alternative
   teaching / learning methods, within the Physics' domain, using online
   video annotation, in the support of traditional exposition and
   memorization methodologies.},

Title = {Role of Video Aids in Learning among Higher Education Students: An
   Observational Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN MEDICAL AND DENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Pages = {359-365},
Abstract = {Introduction: Video-based learning is a form of eLearning that allows
   its audience to acquire skills and gain knowledge via video. This method
   of training is becoming increasingly popular, and starting to replace
   the traditional. They improve learner performance by providing visual
   examples, allowing them to interact, explore and digest the content at
   their own pace. The aim is to find the role of video aids for learning
   among the students of higher education.
   Materials and methods: A simple online survey was carried out to
   investigate the role of video aids for learning among the students of
   higher education. 15 self-explanatory questions were framed and
   distributed to the participants through an Online google forms link. The
   data collected in google sheets were transferred to SPSS software.
   Descriptive statistics and Chi- square were carried out.
   Result: The study shows 81\% of students are interested in video
   learning. Most of the males prefer audio quality but females prefer
   visual content of the video. We observed that 36\% of the participants
   preferred Line out videos and 31\% of them preferred ppt videos. Most of
   the students use YouTube for learning, it provides free access to a huge
   volume of educational videos. This service allows users to watch videos
   and post comments and allows registered users to upload videos. 41\% of
   students prefer the duration of the video to be less than 7 min. 32\% of
   students prefer fast explanation in the video and 51\% prefer the normal
   level of speed in video.
   Conclusion: The video aids were found to be very useful to students in
   learning. preference for video aid for learning is high among students
   if the video has good audio quality, visual resolution and simple
   methods of explanation. The study found that video length impacts their
   viewing decision of students indicating that length should play a factor
   in video learning. The video aids have their own advantages as well as
   their disadvantages, which should be considered when choosing the video
   aids.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},

Month = {2024 AUG 21},
Abstract = {A video lesson with generative learning activities has the potential to
   improve learning by engaging learners. However, existing literature
   regarding designing and implementing an interactive video lesson is
   insufficient. In the present study, we aimed to investigate: a) whether
   the use of the summarizing strategy would benefit learning via video
   with regard to learning outcome, cognitive load, intrinsic motivation,
   and metacognition; and b) which self-explanation prompts would further
   engage learners. A total of 149 university students were randomly
   assigned to one of six conditions formed by a 2 X 3 design with
   self-explanation prompts (structured prompts vs. open-ended prompts) and
   summarizing (constructed summarizing vs. provided summarizing vs. no
   summarizing) as the between-subjects factors. Analysis of covariance
   indicated that: a) the structured prompts reduced extraneous cognitive
   load and fostered metacognition, b) the positive effect of the
   structured prompts on retention was dependent upon no summarizing, and
   c) the provided summarizing strategy resulted in higher perceived
   competence when compared to the constructed summarizing strategy. These
   findings are discussed within the contemporary engagement theory and
   cognitive load theory.},

Abstract = {Most traditional science and engineering instructions in universities
   are topic-based and authoritative, and students do not necessarily feel
   the teaching and its content to be personally important or useful.
   Students' science and engineering learning needs to be more personal,
   authentic, and meaningful to them. In reviewing potential technologies
   for achieving such learning benefit, several studies have found that
   video recording of teachers' own teaching practice as well as its
   viewing and sharing support self-reflection and peers critical review.
   As to students, although videos have become essential to many aspects of
   their daily life, little research has related video recording to their
   engineering learning. This study proposes that, as a type of multimedia,
   videos can be used by students to review and reflect their engineering
   knowledge. The video project requires students to use the multimedia
   technology tools to present an engineering topic as a proposed tandem
   learning of both multimedia and engineering courses. That is, students'
   learning of an engineering subject content is embedded into the
   video-making project in a multimedia course. The corresponding learning
   activities is expected to shed a new light on improving engineering
   education.},

Abstract = {Providing feedback in a LMOOC context is challenging. Video feedback has
   the potential to serve online language learners on a large scale, as
   they can download, study, revise these feedback videos repeatedly and
   hopefully transfer their learning to complete future tasks. Vicarious
   learning feedback videos have not been investigated extensively, as most
   previous studies focused on the extent to which feedback receivers can
   learn from their own mistakes and feedback directly addressed to their
   work. The opportunities to learn from others' mistakes and feedback on
   others' work have more significant potential to serve an extensive
   online learning community. This study filled the gap by investigating
   and comparing learners' preferences and the use of two types of
   vicarious learning feedback videos as self-directed learning resources
   in LMOOCs, i.e., teacher and peer feedback videos.
   This study collected both quantitative and qualitative data from 16 s
   language learners. Quantitative data mainly came from the dashboard of a
   learning management system, including frequency (the frequency of each
   video being played) and engagement level (the proportion of each
   feedback video being watched). Qualitative data referred to
   participants' reflections on their learning experiences with these
   videos. The results suggested that 1) teacher feedback videos were
   watched more frequently than others as learners regarded them as their
   desired performance and ultimate learning goals. They preferred
   teachers' explanations of the expected learning outcomes and
   elaborations of marking rubrics in the videos; and 2) the online
   learners watched a much higher percentage of the content in peer
   feedback videos, which indicated a higher engagement level with the peer
   feedback videos than teacher feedback videos. Interview data suggested
   that it was in the peer feedback videos that online students carried out
   more peer evaluation, self-reflection, and assessment practices.},

Title = {Self-Supervised Video Representation Learning by Serial Restoration With
   Elastic Complexity},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Pages = {2235-2248},
Abstract = {Self-supervised video representation learning leaves out heavy manual
   annotation by automatically excavating supervisory signals. Although
   contrastive learning based approaches exhibit superior performances,
   pretext task based approaches still deserve further study. This is
   because the pretext tasks exploit the nature of data and encourage
   feature extractors to learn spatiotemporal logic by discovering
   dependencies among video clips or cubes, without manual engineering on
   data augmentations or manual construction of contrastive pairs. To
   utilize chronological property more effectively and efficiently, this
   work proposes a novel pretext task, named serial restoration of shuffled
   clips (SRSC), disentangled by an elaborately designed task network
   composed of an order-aware encoder and a serial restoration decoder. In
   contrast to other order based pretext tasks that formulate clip order
   recognition as a one-step classification problem, the proposed SRSC task
   restores shuffled clips into the right order in multiple steps. Owing to
   the excellent elasticity of SRSC, a novel taxonomy of curriculum
   learning is further proposed to equip SRSC with different pre-training
   strategies. According to the factors that affect the complexity of
   solving the SRSC task, the proposed curriculum learning strategies can
   be categorized into task based, model based and data based. Extensive
   experiments are conducted on the subdivided strategies to explore their
   effectiveness and noteworthy laws. Compared with existing approaches,
   this work demonstrates that the proposed approach achieves
   state-of-the-art performances in pretext task based self-supervised
   video representation learning and a majority of the proposed strategies
   further boost the performance of downstream tasks. For the first time,
   the features pre-trained by the pretext tasks are applied to video
   captioning by feature-level early fusion, and enhance the input of
   existing approaches as a lightweight plugin.},

Abstract = {Self-education corresponds to a quest for knowledge without the need for
   a teacher targeting,which sometimes ends up not allowing students to
   seek their own answers. According to Jacques Ranciere (2017), it is this
   self-education that contributes to the intellectual emancipation of the
   subjects. Starting from a view of the classroom as a space for building
   knowledge, that surpasses the classic vision of school communication, in
   which there is only one transmitter and several receivers, denominated
   by Paulo Freire (2005) of ``Banking Education{''}, happened an
   experience of self-regulation of learning. The activity was developed
   with a group of 36 future teachers of the course Letras, Lingua
   Portuguesa, from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil,
   in the Educational Technologies curricular component. The group was
   asked to read the text ``Infancia, midias e aprendizagem: autodidaxia e
   colaboracao{''} (Belloni \& Gomes). Next, in the virtual learning
   environment they should post a link of a video that helped them to
   better understand the proposed theme and the link to a story that covers
   the theme of the text. Then, an explanatory video (like a video lesson)
   of a maximum of 3 minutes was requested, about the text we have been
   studying. The activity was followed by a self-assessment, also available
   in the virtual learning environment. The preparation of the video
   lessons is justified because it is the tool most students use for
   individualized study. The results of the experiment revealed that, by
   having the content studied understandable to others from an audiovisual
   resource with a limited time, future teachers develop the skills of
   analysis and synthesis. Metacognition still contributes to a more
   effective understanding of what is being studied. Future teachers
   conclude that, by making use of this strategy, they enable students to
   develop their intellectual autonomy, in addition to approaching the
   social culture of reference of these subjects, making more meaningful
   what is studied in the school.},

Title = {Motion-guided spatiotemporal multitask feature discrimination for
   self-supervised video representation learning},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {155},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Powerful self -supervised representation models are able to step out of
   the traditional supervised paradigm and rely merely on unlabeled data to
   achieve a deep understanding of visual semantic features. However,
   previous approaches may suffer from background scene bias, making it
   difficult to perform a comprehensive exploration of video spatiotemporal
   structure. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a self
   -supervised video representation learning framework of m otion -guided s
   patiotemporal m ultitask f eature d iscrimination (MSMFD). The method
   mainly utilizes the consistency of motion cues between different views
   to guide the model for spatial and temporal feature similarity
   discrimination. Specifically, the model first selects video clips with
   large motion amplitudes based on the collected optical flow maps.
   Subsequently, the model introduces an instance discrimination task for
   overall spatiotemporal structure perception of the video, while a
   shuffled triplet and an augmented quadruple task are created to further
   enhance the exploration of intraframe sequence order and local spatial
   fine-grained. Furthermore, we propose joint motion alignment of spatial,
   temporal, and spatiotemporal dimensions under different views as a
   powerful compensation for acquiring motion features. Experimental
   results demonstrate that our self -supervised method is effective for
   learning video representations and achieves competitive performance in
   action recognition and video retrieval tasks compared to other
   state-of-the-art methods.},

   360° videos in self-directedlearning},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 10},
Abstract = {360 degrees videos have yielded satisfactory outcomes in English
   learning. However, there exists a dearth of research that delves into
   the efficacy of these videos for self-directed learning of English. This
   study aimed to investigate the factors that influence students' use of
   360 degrees videos in self-directed learning of English by using the
   integrative model of behavior prediction as the theoretical background.
   The study sample consisted of 457 university students from China. A
   questionnaire was used to collect data. The questionnaire entailed few
   open questions and 26 items distributed among six factors: Attitudes,
   self-efficacy, subjective norms, behavioral intention, self-regulated
   skills, and actual use. SPSS 22.0, JASP, and SmartPLS 4 were used for
   data analysis. The results revealed significant direct effects of
   attitudes and self-efficacy on behavioral intention and direct effects
   of behavioral intention and self-regulated skills on actual behavior.
   However, the results showed that subjective norms and self-regulated
   skills did not have a direct effect on the behavioral intention, and
   that behavioral intention did not affect actual behavior through
   self-regulated skills. The implementation of 360 degrees videos garnered
   interest among students for self-directed learning of English. The
   influence of self-regulatory skills on the utilization of 360 degrees
   videos is noteworthy, as it may contribute to fostering a sense of ease
   and comfort among students and other stakeholders.},

Abstract = {As a professional academic supporting unit of the University, The
   Independent Learning Centre (ILC) at The Chinese University of Hong Kong
   (CUHK) has decided to provide additional support by adding sign language
   interpretation versions and subtitles to the existing self-learning
   videos. Such a project is pioneering in Hong Kong in addressing the
   needs of Special Education Needs (SEN) students. The project aims to
   benefit students with different levels of hearing impairment or other
   SEN as well as general students. While the revised videos will allow and
   encourage a wide range of students with different levels of learning
   difficulties to foster their independent learning skills, the added
   subtitles (Cantonese, Mandarin or English) can aid learning in terms of
   retention, comprehension, accuracy and engagement. Such benefit means
   general students are also expected to have their learning effectiveness
   increased by viewing these inclusive design videos. The whole project
   selected 98 videos from different self-designed online platforms, which
   would be over 10 hours in total. Once ready, the videos will be
   incorporated into the redesigned online platform and revised
   micro-modules accordingly. This paper aims to offer a first-handed and
   thorough perspective on the whole project in order to share the
   experience of supporting SEN and general students by making eLearning
   more accessible. When we are carrying out the project, we hope we can
   further benefit academia by sharing our successful experience. We
   believe the aims of the project can be further extended by sharing our
   experience with our academic peers, that is, our partners.},

   Transmission Services},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {24},
Pages = {1350-1365},
Abstract = {Video transmission services adopt adaptive algorithms to ensure users'
   demands. Existing techniques are often optimized and evaluated by a
   function that linearly combines several weighted metrics. Nevertheless,
   we observe that the given function often fails to describe the
   requirement accurately, resulting in the violation of generating the
   required methods. We propose Zwei, a self-play reinforcement learning
   framework that updates the policy by straightforwardly utilizing the
   actual requirement. Technically, Zwei effectively rolls out the
   trajectories from the same initial state, and instantly estimate the win
   rate w.r.t the competition outcome, where the outcome represents which
   trajectory is closer to the assigned requirement. We evaluate Zwei with
   different requirements on various video transmission tasks, including
   adaptive bitrate streaming, crowd-sourced live streaming scheduling, and
   real-time communication. Results indicate that Zwei optimizes itself
   according to the assigned requirement faithfully, outperforming the
   state-of-the-art methods under all considered scenarios. Moreover, we
   further propose Zwei(+), which enables Zwei to learn the policies in the
   vanilla no-regret reinforcement learning scenario. We validate Zwei(+)
   in the adaptive Nitrate streaming task and show the superiority of the
   proposed method over existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

Abstract = {The impact of student-generated videos on students' learning and
   understanding of specific topics has not been fully examined Therefore,
   this study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of student-generated
   videos as an educational collaborative learning tool on a group of
   students' self-reported perceptions and satisfaction levels in a
   preclinical dental course. Third-year students enrolled in a
   biomaterials course having already taken their prerequisites
   participated in this study. They were each asked to produce an
   educational video on one of the many subjects in their dental course
   materials. Three years later, these students perceptions were assessed
   with a 26-item, self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed
   using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). The
   response rate in this study was 85.7\%. The students believed that
   preparing the video scripts motivated them to read about the topics
   (52.5\%) and to work with a team (55\%). Education, Approximately 73\%
   of the students agreed that preparing the videos enhanced their
   understanding of dental materials and their applications in both the lab
   and the clinic. About 76\% of the participants learned that the video
   medium can be a powerful communication tool. In addition, the videos
   improved their understanding of teamwork, as well as their
   communication, problem-solving, and organizational skills. These videos
   also improved their responsibility and professional behavior toward
   their dental teams. Almost all of the students perceived the student
   generated video as a contemporary, essential educational tool that
   enhances student collaborative learning and problem solving, promotes
   mastery of learning, clarifies various topics, and provides authentic
   learning opportunities.},

Abstract = {It is sometimes difficult for the student to participate actively in the
   learning process due to the difficulty that teachers find when trying to
   cover all the contents of a course with sufficient time and attention.
   This lack of time prevents professors from properly stimulating the
   student's active participation in class, which is always necessary for
   achieving a deep and significant learning. The present paper describes a
   flipped-classroom-based methodology that fosters autonomous learning of
   applied mathematics contents using short educational videos. The use of
   on-line media learning resources has dramatically increased in the last
   decade in higher education, not only under the well-known flipped
   classroom approach but also as replacement of conventional face-to-face
   lectures. The application of this methodology will give professors more
   time to make students work actively and cooperatively at class in the
   application of mathematical techniques for solving complex exercises and
   problems.},

Title = {Attentive spatial-temporal contrastive learning for self-supervised
   video representation},
Journal = {IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {137},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Most existing self-supervised works learn video representation by using
   a single pretext task. A single pretext task, providing single
   supervision from unlabeled data, may neglect to describe the difference
   between spatial features and temporal features. The similar spatial
   features and temporal features may hinder distinguishing between two
   similar videos with different class labels. In this paper, we propose an
   attentive spatial-temporal contrastive learning network (ASTCNet), which
   learns self-attention spatial-temporal features by contrastive learning
   between multiple spatial and temporal pretext tasks. The spatial
   features are learned by multiple spatial pretext tasks, including
   spatial rotation, and spatial jigsaw. Each spatial feature is enhanced
   with spatial selfattention by learning the relation between patches. The
   temporal features are learned by multiple temporal pretext tasks,
   including temporal order, and temporal pace. Each temporal feature is
   enhanced with temporal self-attention by learning the relation between
   frames, and is enhanced by feeding the optical flow features into a
   motion module. To separate the spatial feature and the temporal feature
   learned in one video, we represent the video as different features for
   each pretext task, and design pretext task-based contrastive loss. The
   pretext taskbased contrastive loss encourages the different pretext
   tasks to learn dissimilar features, and encourages the same pretext task
   to learn similar features. The pretext task-based contrastive loss can
   learn the discriminative features for each pretext task in one video.
   The experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
   performance for self-supervised action recognition on the UCF101 dataset
   and the HMDB51 dataset.},

Abstract = {Instance-wise contrastive learning (Instance-CL), which learns to map
   similar instances closer and different instances farther apart in the
   embedding space, has achieved considerable progress in self-supervised
   video representation learning. However, canonical Instance-CL does not
   handle properly the temporal similarities between different videos,
   limiting the representation capabilities of learned models. This paper
   presents a novel two-stage framework that combines Instance-CL and
   unsupervised clustering to progressively learn desirable temporal
   representations with high intra-class compactness. Specifically, (a) we
   first introduce a new consistency-preserving sampling strategy to
   generate positive/negative pairs. Compared to the traditional sampling
   methods, our sampling strategy focuses more on motion dynamics,
   resulting in more temporal-related feature representations. (b) To
   further explore the temporal similarities between videos so as to
   encourage intra-class compactness, we set temporal representations
   extracted from Instance-CL as an initializer, and iteratively use
   k-means clustering to generate pseudo-labels for training the encoder.
   We term our method as Improved Instance-CL with Deep Clustering (ICDC)
   and apply it to two downstream tasks, including action recognition and
   video retrieval. Extensive experimental results show that ICDC gains
   considerable improvements compared to the existing self-supervised
   methods.},

Abstract = {This article describes the research landscape related to the use of
   video for promoting teacher learning, drawing on a variety of research
   studies to illustrate the breadth of approaches that have been employed.
   One particular research study is reported in some detail since, it is
   argued, this represents a new level of devolution of agency to teachers
   to play a self-scaffolding role in their own professional education. The
   study involved the investigation of an approach to the provision of
   feedback to teachers about their practice that involved stimulating
   teacher self-reflection and juxtaposed structure and agency. An
   observation framework grounded in classroom practice research was
   developed, and teachers selected elements of that framework to serve as
   the focus for examining their practice and seeking feedback about that
   practice. Teachers and researchers examined video-recorded lessons
   focusing on the teachers' selected observation elements, and then
   engaged in feedback conversations about their observations and analyses,
   and the implications of these for future practice. The approach
   identified the video record as an artefact of the teacher's own practice
   and one which demanded a professional response from the teacher. The
   balance between structure and agency realised in the study, in
   combination with the use of video for observation and analysis of
   practice, facilitated teacher self-reflection and functioned to both
   support and provoke teacher learning.},

Abstract = {New instructional technologies have been increasingly incorporated into
   the medical school learning environment, including lecture video
   recordings as a substitute for live lecture attendance. The literature
   presents varying conclusions regarding how this alternative experience
   impacts students' academic success. Previously, a multi-year study of
   the first-year medical histology component at the University of Michigan
   found that live lecture attendance was positively correlated with
   learning success, while lecture video use was negatively correlated.
   Here, three cohorts of first-year medical students (N=439 respondents,
   86.6\% response rate) were surveyed in greater detail regarding lecture
   attendance and video usage, focusing on study behaviors that may
   influence histology learning outcomes. Students who reported always
   attending lectures or viewing lecture videos had higher average
   histology scores than students who employed an inconsistent strategy
   (i.e., mixing live attendance and video lectures). Several behaviors
   were negatively associated with histology performance. Students who
   engaged in non-lecture activities (e.g., social media use), students who
   reported being interrupted while watching the lecture video, or feeling
   sleepy/losing focus had lower scores than their counterparts not
   engaging in these behaviors. This study suggests that interruptions and
   distractions during medical learning activitieswhether live or
   recordedcan have an important impact on learning outcomes. Anat Sci Educ

Abstract = {BioScientix is an innovative teacher education course directed to
   prospective biology teachers of the secondary level. The goal is to
   offer an innovative learning environment at an early stage of their
   academic education {[}1]. In a ``Community of Practice (CoP){''} {[}2]
   of scientists, science educators and media educators the teacher
   students develop ``explain-it{''} videos about biological themes. The
   CoP has a blended learning structure {[}3], where face-to-face meetings
   and exchange via an e-learning platform are offered {[}4]. During the
   course the teacher students work in teams. They analyze different
   scientific contents in the field of ecology and cell biology and make
   didactical and medial transformations by writing a story boards and
   produce `` explain-it{''} videos. At least they evaluate their
   self-produced videos in academic courses (peer evaluation).
   The meta-evaluation of the course BioScientix is on two levels: 1) on
   the system level we analyze the affordances {[}5] and the arrangement of
   the learning environment; 2) on the personal level we investigate the
   participants' professional development, their development of subject
   knowledge and pedagogical content knowledge (PCK). We use qualitative
   and quantitative methods to gather data: questionnaires
   (pre-post-design) and participants' portfolios and videos and analyze
   them based on the paradigm of the Qualitative Content Analysis {[}6].
   Within the last two years 41 ongoing biology teacher students
   participated in the BioScientix study program. They developed 17
   ``explain-it{''} videos. The findings of the meta-evaluation demonstrate
   an increase of subject and didactical knowledge of the participating
   teacher students. Most of them highlight the relevance of the
   BioScientix for the future career as teachers. In addition, the learning
   environment encourages students' interest and motivation.},

Abstract = {Numerous video-based programs have been developed to support mathematics
   teachers in reflecting on and examining classrooms interactions without
   the immediate demands of instruction. An important premise of such work
   is that teacher learning occurs at the time that the video is viewed and
   discussed with teachers. Recent advances in technology, however, offer
   new approaches for the use of video with teachers. We claim that these
   new technologies provide important opportunities for teacher learning
   prior to the viewing and discussion of video with colleagues. In
   particular, we believe that important teacher learning can occur from
   the activities of (1) capturing video from one's own classroom and (2)
   selecting clips to share with others. The goal of this article is to
   introduce key strategies that three groups of middle and high school
   mathematics teachers use prior to, during, and after instruction as they
   engage in this work. We believe that increased attention to these
   strategies is necessary in order to better understand how to support
   teacher learning in the context of new digital technologies.},

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine the effect of
   scenario-based interactive videos, on students' achievement and their
   development of self-regulated learning behaviors, when used in an
   English grammar course. Scenario-based interactive videos can present an
   experience-centered learning environment that enables students to be
   more active in the learning process. A true experimental research design
   was used. The sample consisted of 84 seventh-grade non-native speakers
   from an elementary school. The students were divided into two groups.
   The experimental group used scenario-based interactive videos, while the
   control group used non-scenario-based interactive videos. Pre and
   post-tests were conducted to measure achievements of the students in
   each group. Moreover, screen log data were examined to evaluate their
   self-regulated learning behaviors. Finally, the results showed that the
   students in the experimental group were more successful than those in
   control group with regard to their achievement level on the posttest.
   The experimental group showed self-regulated learning behaviors more
   than the control group did.},

   relation to studies on self-narration. as a reflective activity.
   60 primary school pupils - thirty 7 year olds and thirty 8 year olds
   were observed during the making of documentaries about their school
   experience. The information gathered from classroom video recorded

Abstract = {Lecture video archives offer hundreds of lectures. Students have to
   watch lecture videos in a lecture archive without any feedback. They do
   not know if they understood everything correctly in comparison to MOOCs
   (Massive Open Online Course) where a direct feedback with self-tests or
   assignments is common. In contrast to MOOCs, video lecture archives
   normally do not offer self-test or assignment sections after every
   video. Due to this behavior of lecture archives questions have to be
   made visible on the video page. Furthermore, lecture recording videos
   are typically longer than videos in MOOCs. So, it is not so reasonable
   and sometimes even demotivating to ask a lot of questions after a long
   video when not all information is already memorized by the student. The
   approach of this paper is to overcome these self-test problems in
   lecture video archives and to finally solve them in a reasonable way to
   increase the learning experience and support students to learn more
   efficient with recorded lecture videos.},

Abstract = {BackgroundFor engineering students, a lack of motivation and continuous
   study are common issues that lie in low academic performance. Active
   teaching with audio-visual systems, on the one hand, and self-regulated
   learning methodologies, on the other, have shown to have a high
   potential in these aspects.PurposeAssessing a proposal based on a
   self-assessment and integrating it into a traditional teaching process
   to improve student engagement and performance.Design/MethodWhen once
   explanation of a thematic block was complete, we set a series of
   exercises encompassing key concepts for students to solve at home within
   a limited time. Students then had to upload their solutions to an
   e-Learning platform and subsequently received dynamic videos, created
   using a lightboard studio, showing solutions to the exercises to assess
   their level of learning through self-evaluation.ResultsThe activity was
   highly valued by the students. They were more motivated in their studies
   than the control group, which is reflected in increased participation in
   the course and in the number of students who sat for the exams. However,
   according to the metrics of the videos and their responses to the
   questionnaires, students did not fully utilise the available resources.
   This is likely due to the extrinsic motivation facilitated or failure to
   treat the self-assessments as exam simulations. This resulted in
   academic performance that is very similar to that of the control
   group.ConclusionsThe results obtained demonstrate the usefulness of the
   teaching proposal for the purpose of this work, although it requires
   some improvements.},

Abstract = {This paper presents a novel framework of self-supervised learning for
   video representation. Inspired by Contrastive Predictive Coding and
   Self-attention, we make the following contributions: First, we propose
   the Contrastive Predictive Coding with Transformer (CPCTR) framework for
   video representation learning in a self-supervised fashion. Second, we
   introduce the Transformer architecture to CPCTR to capture long-range
   spatio-temporal dependencies in order to facilitate the learning of
   ``slow features{''} in video, and we conduct analysis of Transformer in
   our model to show its effectiveness. Finally, we evaluate our model by
   first training on the UCF101 dataset with self-supervised learning, and
   then fine-tuning on downstream video classification tasks. Using RGB
   only video data, we achieve state-of-the-art self-supervised performance
   on both UCF101 (Top1 accuracy of 99.3\%) and HMDB51 (Top1 accuracy of
   82.4\%), we show that CPCTR even outperforms fully supervised methods on
   the two datasets. The code is available at

Abstract = {Several educational institutions in the world have faced severe problems
   in Indonesia. The Indonesian government made the policy of limiting
   face-to-face learning activities to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic
   recently. Self-learning is one way to overcome problems that occur so
   that the learning process continues to run well, especially during this
   pandemic. The development of technology science also plays an essential
   role in education today. Efforts to include technology in education in
   the form of a textbook and video assistant based on self-learning are
   needed by students to improve their Arabic calligraphy writing skills.
   This study aims to produce textbooks and video assistants based on
   self-learning for Institute Sunan Giri Ponorogo students to help the
   learning process of Arabic calligraphy, which is easy and exciting and
   reveals viability and effectiveness. This research method was Borg and
   Gall's proposed research and development (R\&D) proposed by Borg and
   Gall. Then the data were analyzed quantitatively and qualitatively. This
   study indicates that the development of Arabic calligraphy learning
   material in a textbook and video assistant based on self-learning has
   been developed according to procedures. The results of testing the
   components of the Arabic calligraphy material show that: material
   experts assess product development as very good and feasible while
   learning design experts consider teaching material very good and
   feasible. Then, the test subjects assessed that the material learning
   components were excellent. The results of the product effectiveness test
   show that the Arabic calligraphy learning material based on
   self-learning was influential in helping the learning process that was
   easy and interesting.},

Abstract = {In modern language education there is a growing tendency to use online
   accessible audio-visual data to incorporate authentic language use in
   the didactic practice {[}1], {[}2], {[}3], {[}4], {[}5]. Despite the
   vast growth of online accessible audio-visual material (such as
   streaming media), there is still need for its systematic didactic
   embedding.
   The key purpose of the VIDEO. DE project is the development of a
   technological-didactic tool, by which audio-visual material from
   existing online resources can be implemented in academic language
   education. The actual elaboration of the tool is done in a pilot study
   for German as a foreign language and involves collaboration between
   different partner institutions of the Association KU Leuven in Belgium.
   In the first step a layered and fine-grained annotation scheme is
   designed for the multiple coding of the videos with parameters such as
   genre, vocabulary, grammar and discursive features. The next step
   involves the development of an online and user-friendly annotation and
   transcription tool as well as a didactic user interface. In order to
   advance students' interactive use of the audio-visual material, two
   innovative work forms are introduced: (a) an analysis module, which
   consists of an interactive annotation environment for the independent
   coding of videos by students according to a task-specific annotation
   template, and (b) an online-exercise module with interactive exercises
   and assignments attached to every parameter in the annotation scheme.
   The design of both the technological tool and the annotation module
   allows for the further expandability to other academic language programs
   than German.
   The effect of the VIDEO. DE method on the learning results and
   motivation of the students compared to the traditional method will be
   measured in a small-scale case study. Furthermore, the instructors and
   the students will be presented with a questionnaire, which assesses
   their motivation, involvement, self-activation and the general
   user-friendliness of the tool. The preliminary results of this testing
   phase will contribute to the integration of the VIDEO. de method in the
   curriculum of the partner institutions for German language instruction.
   The open database structure of VIDEO. DE will allow students and
   language instructors to gain direct access to relevant streaming video
   material, which can then serve as illustration material for certain
   phenomena in language. In contrast to most existing language learning
   environments based on video data, the VIDEO. de project provides a
   strongly student-centered annotation environment and interface, which
   stimulates students to engage in a process of collaborative annotation
   across the partner institutions.},

Title = {Video-based reflection in teacher education: Comparing virtual reality
   and real classroom videos},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {190},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {While previous studies have examined the use of real-world classroom
   videos to support the development of student teachers' reflective
   skills, there has been little research to date on the use of virtual
   reality (VR) videos in teacher education to provide opportunities for
   authentic reflec-tion. This mixed-methods study investigated changes in
   reflection-related self-efficacy and dif-ferences in written reflection
   processes using a quasi-experimental design with two types of reflection
   stimuli. One group of 46 student teachers used a VR-based video to
   reflect on in-struction while another group of 23 student teachers used
   a real classroom video. We found an increase in reflection-related
   self-efficacy over time among participants in the VR group only. We also
   found that VR videos triggered similar reflection processes to real
   classroom videos. This study shows, for the first time, that video-based
   reflection on VR classroom videos produced comparable results to
   reflection on real classroom videos. This indicates that VR can be used
   successfully in teacher education and that it offers a useful learning
   tool for teacher education programs.},

Year = {2009},

Pages = {169-176},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {This paper presents an evaluation case study that describes the
   experiences of 15 students and 2 teachers using a video-based learning
   environment, DiViDU, to facilitate students' daily reflection activities
   in a composition course and a ballet course. To support dance students'
   reflection processes streaming video was applied as follows: video
   editing and viewing for facilitating students in describing their
   practice; writing online self-assessments about the experiences captured
   on video to support students in evaluating their practice; online
   peer-feedback activities concerning the recorded practice for
   facilitating students in learning from multiple perspectives. In the
   composition course eight students reflected on their choreographic work,
   which was performed by their peer students. In the ballet course seven
   students reflected on themselves practicing the ballet technique. Data
   about the streaming video facilitation were collected after the
   completion of the reflection assignments using semi-structured
   interviews. The results revealed that students in both courses
   considered steaming video as effective for carrying out
   self-evaluations. The usefulness of video and online peer-feedback for
   other reflection processes differed among the courses in students' view.
   The teachers considered streaming video generally useful for all the
   reflection processes of their students; however they also indicated some
   shortcomings. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Presenting novices with examples and problems is an effective and
   efficient way to acquire new problem-solving skills. Nowadays, examples
   and problems are increasingly presented in computer-based learning
   environments, in which learners often have to self-regulate their
   learning (i.e., choose what type of task to work on and when). Yet, it
   is questionable how novices self-regulate their learning from examples
   and problems, and to what extent their choices match with effective
   principles from instructional design research. In this study, 147 higher
   education students had to learn how to solve problems on the trapezoidal
   rule. During self-regulated learning, they were free to select six tasks
   from a database of 45 tasks that varied in task format (video examples,
   worked examples, practice problems), complexity level (level 1, 2, 3),
   and cover story. Almost all students started with (video) example study
   at the lowest complexity level. The number of examples selected
   gradually decreased and task complexity gradually increased during the
   learning phase. However, examples and lowest level tasks remained
   relatively popular throughout the entire learning phase. There was no
   relation between students' total score on how well their behavior
   matched with the instructional design principles and learning outcomes,
   mental effort, and motivational variables.},

Abstract = {This study explores the types of learning profiles that evolve from
   student use of video annotation software for reflective learning. The
   data traces from student use of the software were analysed across four
   undergraduate courses with differing instructional conditions. That is,
   the use of graded or non-graded self-reflective annotations. Using
   hierarchical cluster analysis, four profiles of students emerged:
   minimalists, task-oriented, disenchanted, and intensive users. Students
   enrolled in one of the courses where grading of the video annotation
   software was present, were exposed to either another graded course
   (annotations graded) or non-graded course (annotations not graded) in
   their following semester of study. Further analysis revealed that in the
   presence of external factors (i.e., grading), more students fell within
   the task-oriented and intensive clusters. However, when the external
   factor is removed, most students exhibited the disenchanted and
   minimalist learning behaviors. The findings provide insight into how
   students engage with the different features of a video annotation tool
   when there are graded or non-graded annotations and, most importantly,
   that having experience with one course where there are external factors
   influencing students' use of the tool is not sufficient to sustain their
   learning behaviour in subsequent courses where the external factor is
   removed.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effectiveness of asynchronous video material as
   a supplementary educational tool for trainees in hematopathology.
   Traditional pedagogical methods often rely heavily on faculty
   involvement, potentially limiting the breadth of information trainees
   receive due to constraints in faculty time and the variety of cases
   covered in a limited time interval/rotation. Asynchronous video-based
   learning presents a potential solution to these challenges. This concept
   has been utilized effectively in various fields of medical education. In
   this study, we describe our implementation of an educational program
   utilizing asynchronous video material to supplement traditional learning
   methods for peripheral blood smear interpretation for learners on a
   hematopathology clerkship. Following a pre-test/post-test assessment
   with 13 trainees, we analyzed the correlation between video viewing
   percentage and changes in test scores. The results indicate an
   improvement in test scores following exposure to video content,
   supporting the positive impact of asynchronous video material on
   hematopathology education. Trainees had positive feedback regarding this
   new educational tool. This study suggests that such self-directed
   learning could enhance traditional teaching methods, ensuring broader

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Once a video sequence is organized as basic shot units, it is of great
   interest to temporally link shots into semantic-compact scene segments
   to facilitate long video understanding. However, it still challenges
   existing video scene boundary detection methods to handle various visual
   semantics and complex shot relations in video scenes. We proposed a
   novel self-supervised learning method, Video Scene Montage for Boundary
   Detection (VSMBD), to extract rich shot semantics and learn shot
   relations using unlabeled videos. More specifically, we present Video
   Scene Montage (VSM) to synthesize reliable pseudo scene boundaries,
   which learns task-related semantic relations between shots in a
   self-supervised manner. To lay a solid foundation for modeling semantic
   relations between shots, we decouple visual semantics of shots into
   foreground and background. Instead of costly learning from scratch as in
   most previous self-supervised learning methods, we build our model upon
   large-scale pre-trained visual encoders to extract the foreground and
   background features. Experimental results demonstrate VSMBD trains a
   model with strong capability in capturing shot relations, surpassing
   previous methods by significant margins. The code is available at
   https://github.com/mini-mind/VSMBD.},

Abstract = {Video-based online learning is becoming commonplace in higher education
   settings. Prior studies have suggested design principles and
   instructional strategies to boost video-based learning. However, little
   research has been done on different learner characteristics, such as how
   learners behave, what behavioral patterns they exhibit, and how
   different they are from each other. To fill this research gap in
   student-video interaction, we employed learning analytics to obtain
   useful insights into students' learning in the context of video-based
   online learning. From 11 log behaviors represented by log data from 72
   college students, four behavioral patterns were identified while
   students learned from videos: browsing, social interaction, information
   seeking, and environment configuration. Based on the behavioral patterns
   observed, participants were classified into two clusters. Participants
   in the active learner cluster exhibited frequent use of social
   interaction, information seeking, and environment configuration, while
   participants in the passive learner cluster exhibited only frequent
   browsing. We found that active learners exhibited higher learning
   achievement than passive learners.},

Abstract = {This article describes the evaluation of a programme which utilised
   video self-modelling to develop communication skills and associated
   skills of reflection and self-assessment within social work education at
   the Robert Gordon University in Aberdeen, Scotland. Video self-modelling
   techniques were adopted utilising role-play scenarios, simulating
   situations commonly encountered in social work practice, with social
   work students prior to their first period of Practice Learning. Eleven
   participants were observed via video footage and independently rated
   according to the communication skills they displayed. Group discussion
   in conjunction with pre- and post-test questionnaires encouraged
   participants to reflect on their practice.
   Findings The greatest increase in the frequency of observations of
   desirable communication skills was most often achieved by participants
   who had scored the lowest in the rating of their skills during the
   pre-test videos. Overall there was no statistically significant
   difference between the pre- and post-tests scores with regard to the
   communication skills demonstrated. By contrast, all 11 participants
   expressed a belief that the majority of their skills had improved as a
   result of experiencing video self-modelling techniques which led to a
   greater level of reflective practice and growth in self-efficacy with
   regard to their professional competence.
   Applications This approach can be applied to measure the impact
   development of communication skills on social work courses.},

Abstract = {Audiovisual content is highly employed in modern education curricula.
   This study aimed to identify students' perceptions regarding the use of
   video in the courses they attend. Quantitative research was conducted
   among students of journalism and communication studies. Four courses
   were used for this study that employ video-based and video-assisted
   teaching strategies for active learning. Students used videos in
   different educational settings for flipped learning, blended learning,
   and autonomous self-paced learning. Their perceptions were examined
   through an extended form of the Technology Acceptance Model,
   encompassing more parameters (such as self-efficacy, perceived
   enjoyment, satisfaction, attitude, and intention of use) to identify
   causal relationships. In addition, the roles of technical parameters,
   such as internet connection, audio quality, and video quality, along
   with the duration of a video, were explored. The findings reveal
   students' positive attitudes towards videos, and all factors were
   significantly related to the intention of use. In addition, the
   technical aspects of the video did not constitute a problem in the
   educational process, most likely due to contemporary quality in internet
   connections and audiovisual productions along with playback equipment.
   The duration of the videos was also not presented as an issue as there
   are flexible ways to embed videos in the learning process. Overall,
   videos can be used in multiple active learning scenarios to enhance
   students' motivation and engagement and provide a joyful, collaborative,
   and hospitable learning environment. Students are familiar with digital
   tools and technologies and seem to enjoy audiovisual material in the

Abstract = {Studies show that interactive educational video can reduce cognitive
   overload, guide viewers' attention, and trigger reflection; moreover,
   tablets can help students to increase self-directed learning, take
   ownership of the learning process, and collaborate with one another. In
   this study, we examine whether interactive video together with tablets
   and an online course learning environment can become the means for
   promoting efficient and effective self-paced learning in the classroom.
   In traditional elementary classes, students most often play a somewhat
   passive role in pacing and organizing their learning progress. Students
   in our study were asked to follow a learning path of interactive videos
   and other learning units in pairs while the teacher played only a
   supportive role. Two classes of fifth grade (30 students) and two
   classes of sixth grade (30 students) exploited the proposed environment
   for two 90min' sessions. The interactive videos and learning activities
   were designed to address students' misconceptions about heat transfer.
   Data were collected through pre-post tests, focus groups, attitude
   questionnaires for students/teachers, and researchers' observations.
   Students scored significantly higher in the post-test than they did in
   the pretest and they were very positive about the prospects of the
   proposed approach, which they associated with pros such as learning
   efficiency, learning effectiveness, self-directed learning, enjoyment,
   and better classroom dynamics. Students demonstrated impressive
   self-control, self-discipline, and learning autonomy and successfully
   managed their own progress. The study shows that the proposed learning

Abstract = {To improve medication education for patients with hearing loss,
   pharmacists must better understand hearing loss and provide and collect
   medication information based on patients' health literacy and
   communication abilities. However, no systematic educational e-learning
   systems for hearing loss are currently available. Therefore, an
   e-learning system based on instructional design, microlearning
   principles, and multimedia teaching materials was developed. The
   e-learning system used Moodle, an open-source e-learning system, and
   included two courses: one for self-directed learning by watching videos
   and answering quizzes, and another for evaluating medication education
   after learning. A study was conducted on 84 pharmacists and 36 pharmacy
   students who took the learning course to investigate the factors that
   hinder their understanding and progress of self-directed learning.
   Although they fully understood the content by watching videos, students
   with no experience in medication education required an explanation to
   understand how to communicate with patients. As the learning course was
   self-directed and related to communication lectures, all students
   completed it; however, the completion rate for pharmacists was
   approximately 50\%. The following factors could have slowed pharmacists'
   e-learning progress: difficulty accessing the learning course through
   system login and long-duration content, such as answers to free
   descriptions. This survey found that this e-learning method can be used
   for self-directed learning about medication education for patients with
   hearing loss. Further improvement of the e-learning system is necessary
   so that recognizing the need to understand hearing loss and take
   appropriate actions for patients with hearing loss in medication
   education can lead to self-directed learning among pharmacists.},

Abstract = {This study attempts to advance the comprehension of clickstream data in
   video-based learning environments and interpret learning motivation from
   these large-volume and unstructured data. Three hundred and fifty
   video-learning records from 47,044 video viewing operations were
   ob-tained from 47 graduate students. Four learning improvement profiles
   were derived from a sta-tistics course's pre-and post-test scores: the
   Advanced, the Diligent, the Indifferent, and the Persistent. The results
   indicated that the Diligent and the Persistent paused videos frequently.
   These students reflected the need with these self-paced breaks to take
   notes according to the retrospective interview. The Advanced
   demonstrated the highest SkippingBackward frequency with a small
   SkippingBackward time ratio, revealing confidence in searching the
   desired clips. In contrast, the Indifferent exhibited the least
   frequency but the largest time ratio for Skipping-Backward, implying
   distraction problems. In addition, this study showed that the Pause time
   ratio was indirectly related to weekly quiz scores via autonomous
   motivation with marginal signifi-cance. Based on these results, we
   demonstrate that learning motivation can be revealed from dynamic
   clickstreams in video-based learning (i.e., the interaction between
   students and learning contexts), supporting its dynamic developmental
   mechanism. The authors suggest that instructors offer on-demand
   instructional materials and implement top-down video-viewing strategies

Abstract = {The importance of video as a medium for the delivery of learning
   resources, both in distance and mixed learning environments and in
   conventional classrooms (through the use of `flipped classrooms', for
   example) is undeniable. When producing and delivering video learning
   resources, Mayer's multimedia learning principles {[}1] are of paramount
   importance. In many domains Sweller's worked-out example effect is
   essential, as are Chi and Renkl's self-explanations principle (implying
   generation of inferences, integration of statements, and deep analysis)
   {[}2]. In order to apply Renkl's work to online video to provide
   effective guidance to passive and superficial self-explainers it is
   necessary to acquire a better understanding of students' video
   consumption patterns. The field of learning analytics provides a
   framework for this objective. Important work on the subject has been
   done by Kim et al and by Chorianopoulos {[}3,4]. Both have developed
   tools that collect that kind of information. Kim and Chorianopoulos
   focus on the aggregate behaviour of all students watching a video.
   Our work puts the focus on individual behaviour, in order to detect
   patterns associated with effective learning based on self-explanations
   (measured in terms of increased academic performance and engagement and
   improvement of the learning experience). In order to do that we have
   developed independently a tool. We present the tool to collect
   individual usage pattern data and two novel visualizations for the
   gathered data. In order to make use with existing learning environments
   easier our tool works on self-hosted and Vimeo and YouTube videos
   embedded on a web page and uses commonly available web technologies.
   While our work is still on the early steps we show as an important first
   result examples of collected data providing important, actionable
   information that expands instructors' anticipated expectations and that
   we could not have obtained through strictly qualitative approaches, if
   only because of the inability to test all students.
   We discuss on the limitations of a strictly quantitative approach based
   on learning analytics and suggest a mixed methodology in order to
   maximize our understanding of student behaviour, especially for
   unexpected patterns. This suggested methodology should allow us to
   provide effective guidance to passive and superficial self-explainers in
   order to improve their learning.
   Finally, we explore the possibilities offered by our tool to further
   enhance learning from video learning resources, both for all students
   and for particular groups as a response to certain students' behaviour
   patterns.},

Title = {Training self-regulated learning skills with video modeling examples: Do
   task-selection skills transfer?},
Journal = {INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {46},
Number = {2},
Pages = {273-290},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Self-assessment and task-selection skills are crucial in self-regulated
   learning situations in which students can choose their own tasks. Prior
   research suggested that training with video modeling examples, in which
   another person (the model) demonstrates and explains the cyclical
   process of problem-solving task performance, self-assessment, and
   task-selection, is effective for improving adolescents' problem-solving
   posttest performance after self-regulated learning. In these examples,
   the models used a specific task-selection algorithm in which perceived
   mental effort and self-assessed performance scores were combined to
   determine the complexity and support level of the next task, selected
   from a task database. In the present study we aimed to replicate prior
   findings and to investigate whether transfer of task-selection skills
   would be facilitated even more by a more general, heuristic
   task-selection training than the task-specific algorithm. Transfer of
   task-selection skills was assessed by having students select a new task
   in another domain for a fictitious peer student. Results showed that
   both heuristic and algorithmic training of self-assessment and
   task-selection skills improved problem-solving posttest performance
   after a self-regulated learning phase, as well as transfer of
   task-selection skills. Heuristic training was not more effective for
   transfer than algorithmic training. These findings show that
   example-based self-assessment and task-selection training can be an
   effective and relatively easy to implement method for improving
   students' self-regulated learning outcomes. Importantly, our data
   suggest that the effect on task-selection skills may transfer beyond the
   trained tasks, although future research should establish whether this
   also applies when trained students perform novel tasks themselves.},

Abstract = {This study examined self-recorded video-speaking tasks of 48 Korean
   university students in an online English for Special Purposes (ESP)
   course to determine the task's contribution to learners' self-regulation
   while learning English as a foreign language (EFL). Students selected
   and researched topics in science and engineering, self-recording
   three-to-five-minute speaking videos and sharing them via a learning
   management system (LMS) with unsynchronized question-and-answer (Q\&A)
   peer interaction. Then, they submitted self-reflections on their course
   experiences. I analyzed speaking videos and self-reflections to examine
   self-regulation. The results showed positive speaking proficiency but
   less sufficient pronunciation and grammar than other components
   (fluency, vocabulary, and content), suggesting that EFL learners in ESP
   courses require more effort in learning technical terms in their natural
   spoken language. Also, they intertwined components of Zimmerman and
   Moylan's (2009) three-phase self-regulated model into their tasks. They
   linked subsequent goal-setting to motivation and self-efficiency. The
   self-recording process provided opportunities to rehearse pronunciation,
   fluency, and organization; an imagery process helped cognitive memory
   for fluency and vocabulary. Technology was a good helping tool to
   support self-taught learning. However, instructors should guide speaking
   with a camera on or not simply reading from pre-written manuscripts for
   better self-regulated learning.},

Abstract = {COVID-19 has resulted in the increased use of distance learning around
   the world. With the advancement of information technology, traditional
   classroom teaching has gradually integrated the Internet and distance
   learning methods. Students need to be able to learn on their own in a
   distance learning environment, so their ability to self-regulate their
   learning in a distance learning environment cannot be ignored. However,
   in previous studies on self-regulated learning, most learners learn
   alone. When they have academic doubts, they cannot obtain help and
   support from their studies, resulting in reduced learning outcomes. This
   study uses the peer self-disciplined learning mechanism to establish a
   distance teaching system that assists students and to improve their own
   learning status by meeting with peers at a distance. It can also help
   learners orient themselves by observing their peers' learning status and
   goal considerations. The participants in this study were 112 college
   students in the department of information management. The control group
   used a general self-regulated teaching system for learning, and the
   experimental group used a distance learning system, incorporating peer
   self-regulated learning. The results of the study found that learners
   who used the distance peer learning mechanism were more effective than
   those who used the general distance self-regulated learning system;
   learners who used the distance peer-regulated learning mechanism had
   better motivation, self-efficacy, and reflection after the learning
   activity than those who used the general distance self-regulated
   learning system. In addition, with the aid of such mechanisms, learners'
   cognitive load can be reduced, and learning effectiveness can be
   improved.},

Abstract = {Human-centric content-based video retrieval has emerged as a prominent
   area of research due to its diverse applications. However, this task
   presents several inherent challenges, including end-to-end image
   classification and data sampling. Despite the significant progress made
   by self-supervised learning methods in addressing these challenges,
   there are still some issues that need to be addressed. Among those, one
   major concern is the generation of randomly sampled
   inverse-complementary pairs. The process of generating such pairs
   requires careful handling to avoid false positives. Moreover, a common
   assumption that the similarity between video clips is solely temporal
   neglects the role of other factors, such as motion. To address this
   issue, a clustering-based multi-featured self-supervised learning model
   called CMS2L is proposed in this paper. Our model introduces a
   fundamental improvement by fixing intra-class positive sampling to avoid
   false labeling during stage training due to looping clusters.
   Additionally, it employs a second stream with an expanded range of
   features to achieve a more comprehensive representation of actions.
   Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority
   of our proposed model.},

Abstract = {Since the flourishing of progressive education in the late 19th century,
   educators have been called upon to link learning to life and to
   students' experience. With time, educational philosophy changed towards
   emphasizing achievements and standardization of evaluation. Today, in
   the era of information, progressive principles are enjoying a revival
   and receiving new meaning, as project-based study has returned to the
   forefront, accompanied by educational practices that center on the human
   spirit. Contemplative Education encompasses those educational approaches
   that integrate introspection into education, focusing on the human soul
   and spirit.
   This mixed-methods study was designed to examine the process that
   students underwent in preparing a video project, and their perception of
   the personal significance of their work. The project was carried out by
   students of education who created personal video clips based on the
   soundtrack of their lives. Alongside the video project, students
   presented written assignment in which they elaborated on their selection
   of the musical compositions, inquired about them, and explained the
   personal significance of each selection. The project combined creative
   artistic activity and the use of technological tools, allowing for new
   possibilities for personal creation with reference to the studied
   contents.
   The research tools were questionnaires and interviews. The research
   population included 95 students at a college of education. This is a
   phenomenological study focusing on studying the person's individual
   experience.
   The findings reveal that the project constituted a very meaningful
   learning experience for the students. The content categories derived
   were: self-acceptance, self-esteem, meaningful learning, strengthening
   the intergenerational connection, pleasure, creativity, and coping with
   the technological aspect. The students noted that the most significant
   part of preparing the project was collecting materials, sorting them,
   and exercising discretion in their selection. Compared to other tasks
   the students performed as part of their academic training, most of the
   participants rated these projects as more meaningful both as a personal
   experience and a learning experience.},

Title = {The positive impact of introducing public engagement as a self-directed
   learning strategy in undergraduate nervous system education},
Journal = {MEDICAL EDUCATION ONLINE},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Undergraduate medical education in China has shifted from
   educator-centered learning to self-directed learning (SDL) over the past
   few decades. Careful design of public engagement activities can enable
   SDL and empower medical students to pioneer public health and patient
   safety education. In this study, we aimed to innovate nervous system
   education by implementing a public engagement model that empowers
   students to learn about the nervous system by teaching the public. Our
   goal was to generate greater interest in the nervous system at the
   undergraduate stage, inspire students' enthusiasm to pursue a career in
   neurology, and ultimately, contribute to health promotion. During the
   nervous system module of the second year of the undergraduate
   curriculum, students were given the option to participate in the public
   engagement model. Participants were tasked with the creation of
   educational videos focusing on knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors
   associated with the prevention and management of neurological diseases
   and their complications. The videos were made accessible to the general
   public through the university's official channel at the end of the
   semester. A total of 117 students (67.24\% of all students) chose to
   participate in the public engagement model. Female students and those
   with higher Grade Point Averages in the present semester were more
   likely to participate. The model received strong positive feedback from
   participants, as students found the public engagement task helpful in
   learning about the nervous system module as well as in enhancing their
   public engagement skills. Despite the time and effort consumption,
   participating in the public engagement task did not affect students'
   exam scores. The public engagement task is an innovative model in the
   nervous system curriculum and has the potential to be integrated into a
   broader range of undergraduate courses. It empowers medical students to
   pioneer public health and patient safety education.},

Abstract = {Political Education has to face the dilemma that the adolescents it
   wants to reach do not use the media political education normally
   employs, i.e., books, brochures and magazines. This is especially true
   for adolescents from the low-education strata of society who value
   education only - if at all - in an utilitarian way. Given that this
   strata of society is very much inclined towards the new entertainment
   technology and (male) adolescents are especially inclined towards the
   ``new{''} medium of video games, it may be a good idea to utilize the
   enthusiasm of this group for the new media in order to spread the
   contents of political education.
   The questions I will consider in my paper are:
   What kind of content must a video game have to be interesting for the
   target group?
   Are there gender specific differences concerning this content?
   Are there gender specific game genres which are to be employed?
   How does the game have to be designed? Should the game tend towards
   ludus (Game) or paidia (Play)?
   My theses are: The medium of video games offers opportunities for
   reaching those strata of society for political education that have not
   been reached with traditional media. A game programmed to transport
   goals of political education, e.g. the ability for critical judgement
   and self-efficacy, has to tend towards paidia.},

Abstract = {Video has become an important part of teaching and learning in business
   education. While literature has suggested various strategies and
   activities that have been implemented in videobased learning (VBL)
   environments and revealed their impact on student learning outcomes,
   there is a lack of a conceptual model for researchers and practitioners.
   To address this gap, we conducted a systematic review of 62 articles
   published in the past 20 years to propose the conceptual model. This
   model goes beyond cognitive domains and comprises three major
   components. The components are: learning outcomes include self -system,
   metacognitive system, and cognitive system; instructional design
   includes student career development, student skill development, and
   knowledge and concept learning; and effective video design includes
   content design, theory -driven design for human -computer interaction,
   and the use of generative AI. This model guides researchers and
   practitioners to research and teach business courses using VBL. We also
   suggested six future research directions, including investigating the
   relationships between instructional design and learning outcome and the
   applications of AI in VBL.},

Abstract = {Video games are becoming increasingly popular among young people, as the
   virtual worlds they depict seem to be the preferred refuge when it comes
   to escaping reality.
   As educators, we should attempt to study the effects they have on our
   students' minds and, if proven beneficial, use them in our classrooms to
   enhance learning (and the motivation for learning) whenever possible.
   The digital natives we teach nowadays, the so-called screenagers, have
   high expectations of the classroom settings they are a part of.
   Technology, therefore, and video games should be present in such
   learning environments. Moreover, the skills they develop in games should
   be acknowledged and transferred to real-life settings. Games could help
   educators reach out to them, bridging the gap between teachers and
   students in our efforts to provide them with learning contexts endowed
   with meaning. ``Meaning is the feeling that we're part of something
   bigger than ourselves. It's the belief that our lives matter beyond our
   own individual lives.{''} (Jane McGonigal, ``Reality is broken. Why
   games make us better and how they can change the world{''}) Therefore,
   video games players embark on a quest for meaning when entering such
   virtual worlds as those presented in World of Warcraft, for example.
   Most games have four defining traits: a goal (the outcome to be
   achieved), a set of rules (limitations the players have to cope with), a
   feedback system (informing them on the progress they make, which
   represents a great motivation to keep on playing), and voluntary
   participation (the gamer willingly accepts the goal, the rules and the
   feedback system). Since gaming involves voluntary participation, players
   are intrinsically motivated to bring their contribution to the epic
   mission the game takes them on. In addition, the constant feedback given
   to them is nothing but a strong incentive to continue playing. Hence,
   games are all about the ``epic meaning{''}, the ``urgent optimism{''}
   players feel, the ``social fabric{''} they weave since quite often
   gamers need to collaborate with other players to achieve their goals.
   Therefore, there are all sorts of life skills players acquire in games
   and, most importantly, they can be transferred to reality, the ability
   to work as part of a team being one of them. The findings of the present
   research consist mostly of qualitative data gathered during a case study
   conducted among middle and high school students and adults. There have
   been interviews with teenage and young subjects that come to confirm the
   popularity of games as learning tools and their potential positive
   results in learning environments. Questionnaires and structured
   interviews were used, which led to the collection of data. Using such
   qualitative research methods, we managed to explore the views,
   experiences, beliefs and motivations of individual participants
   regarding gaming, as well as their self-perceived competences acquired
   while playing video games. Among such competences, we can list: strategy
   skills from managing cities and taxing them in order to support armies
   meant to assist the gamers in expanding on the map (as well as
   developing historical knowledge) and connection-making abilities from
   the puzzles they had to solve in order to be able to advance through the
   game. In addition, the research generated an inventory of video games
   classified according to their perceived value.},

   is feasible in culture education. We performed three experiments. The
   results showed that self-directed learning had a good effect, enabling

   although students experienced a culture shock, they were able to
   overcome it by themselves. When the group was learning independently,
   the group members were able to help each other and broaden their
   horizons. Using a self-directed learning method can solve the problem of
   choosing video media, as well as ease the difficulties faced in

Abstract = {Learning videos enjoy great popularity in a digitalized world,
   especially since their use is usually possible regardless of time and
   location. Learners use this advantage mainly in self-study. Supervision,
   as for example in classroom teaching, is rather difficult and learners
   are usually left to their own devices when learning obstacles arise.
   However, not treating learning obstacles can have serious consequences,
   ranging from a gradual loss of the learners' motivation to the
   termination of the learning project. Consequently, learning obstacles
   must be identified and treated in order to support an efficient learning
   process. Fortunately, a digital learning environment opens up many
   opportunities to support learners automatically. This paper explains an
   approach to identify potential learning obstacles in video learning
   based on indirect feedback. The first part of the approach to removing
   learning obstacles in learning videos is based on an analysis of
   learners' click interaction within a video to identify potential problem
   areas. Building on this, the second part provides first thematically
   relevant ad hoc video recommendations for the potentially identified
   learning obstacle. In order to verify whether there is actually a
   learning obstacle, the third part explicitly induces learners to give
   indirect or direct feedback on whether the recommendations have helped
   them and, consequently, whether they have removed an actual learning
   obstacle.},

Abstract = {Since 2008, the Junior Study program of the University of Rostock offers
   study orientation and preparation during the school time for pupils of
   German high schools. For this, regular lectures are recorded and then
   provided via an online learning platform. With 250 young students in
   winter semester 2017/2018, Junior Study program of the University of
   Rostock is one of the biggest and most successful early studies
   offerings in Germany.
   An empirical study, which we conducted at the end of the last semester,
   revealed amongst other things attention and motivation problems of
   students while watching 90-minute university lecture videos. The same
   drawbacks are observed in the plenty of massive open online courses that
   are mainly based on recorded video lectures. Using webcams or cameras of
   mobile devices for capturing, free software for editing, and online
   platforms like YouTube for free sharing, instructional videos can be
   easily and favourably created and distributed. Hence, there's a huge
   selection of videos relating any topic and it's growing every day.
   Although videos became extremely popular as a source for formal and
   informal learning processes, especially long videos are ill-suited for
   the required lifelong learning just in time and on demand. The learning
   success-oriented selection of appropriate video segments and their
   arrangement towards individual learning targets are inhibited. While
   watching a video, already known facts are unnecessarily repeated or
   rather can only be skipped manually. The same problems occur when
   attempting to selectively re-watch certain video sections.
   While providers of massive open online courses therefore tend to produce
   specifically designed videos, which is expensive and time-consuming, we
   follow another approach which includes the semantic processing of
   existing video materials. For this purpose, we developed a web app
   called ``PyQuizMaker{''} that enables users to easily embed quizzes into
   online videos. Based on the Behaviourism theories of Programmed
   Instruction by B. F. Skinner and Branched Programs by Norman Crowder,
   follow-up activities can be specified, that are triggered in dependence
   of the learner's answers. Based on an automatic evaluation of the user's
   current knowledge, the video will adapt according specified behaviours.
   For example, if questions were answered incorrectly, the video may jump
   back to the sections which explain corresponding issues. Otherwise,
   prepended quizzes may check if the knowledge to be conveyed is already
   available. In this case, the video will automatically skip related
   sections. Regularly integrated multiple choice tests can be used as
   learning control and attention grabber. At the same time, a direct
   positive feedback to given correct answers will motivate the student and
   reinforce the learning effect. Moreover, authors can add some additional
   learning materials in terms of text messages, attached files, or
   external websites in order to show alternative learning paths, to deepen
   or complement knowledge.
   In combination with the feature of explicitly defining video sections
   with attached tag words, all these information serves as a basis for
   videos becoming machine-readable. This establishes a wealth of
   application possibilities like scanning videos for specific topics,
   automatic linking to related content, or fully automatic, user-centered
   compilation of individual learning progress-oriented video sections.},

Abstract = {This mixed methods study examines an explanatory video assignment
   designed to operationalize contemporary theory about cognition,
   metacognition, and inclusive teaching. This project grew from a
   professional learning community of post-doctoral teaching fellows who
   were involved in course redesign as part of a campus-wide active
   learning initiative. A team of pedagogical experts, teaching fellows,
   and faculty designed this video assignment to increase opportunities for
   students to share their perspectives while practicing a powerful
   learning strategy. Instructional teams implemented different versions of
   the video assignment in three courses across two departments. An
   experimental research component isolated the impact of the assignment on
   learning and confidence, and a mix of quantitative and qualitative
   analyses provided evidence about students' experiences with the
   assignment. We found that students expressed learning and confidence
   gains beyond those due to typical course activities. Qualitative
   evidence suggested that students experienced the assignment as valuable
   for their learning and that the assignment enhanced self-expression. The
   assignment was effective in both face-to-face and remote settings,
   implemented either as a course requirement or extra-credit option. This
   versatile video assignment presents a practical way to enrich the
   student experience.},

Abstract = {Seamless Learning shall initiate human learning processes that exceeds
   lesson and classroom limits. At the same time this approach fosters a
   self-regulated learning, by means of inspirational, open education
   settings. Advanced learning materials are easily accessible via mobile
   digital devices connected to the Internet. In this study it was explored
   whether and to what extent an open learning approach can be initiated by
   support of videos and incentives. The study took place in a real-world
   setting during a conventional mathematics class in an Austrian secondary
   school with N = 85 children of average age of 10, 6 years. For the
   investigation a traditional face-to-face maths-teaching environment was
   completely replaced by an open learning environment. In our study, the
   elementary learners were able to select their own learning pace and
   preferences via example videos. In addition to the use of an open
   education approach and videos, their learning was also incentivised via
   a reward system of ``stars.{''} A pre-test-post-test-control-group study
   showed that the learning performance significantly increased. The reason
   was due to the combination of a novel teaching and learning setting and
   coupled incentives to foster the learning process.},

Abstract = {Learning factories foster practically oriented teaching-concepts and
   therefore, offer excellent opportunities to develop students'
   competences in self-controlled learning processes (cf. Muller-Frommeyer,
   Aymans, Bargmann, Kauffeld, \& Herrmann, 2017). Two teams of four
   students each were videotaped for one semester during a research-based
   team project at a learning factory. The aim of this paper is to examine
   to what extent the competences identified in the competency model for
   students working with a learning factory by Muller-Frommeyer et al.
   (2017) are addressed in students' task-related group discussions. The
   recorded videos (12,807 sense units) were analyzed using a newly
   developed coding scheme (act4learning) which focuses on learning-related
   competences. Additionally, the students filled in questionnaires
   regarding their computer-related self-efficacy before and after the team
   project. Overall, all examined competences of the model were addressed
   in the students' discussions, but in varying extents. The video data
   shows that interactions are mainly related to professional as well as
   social competences and rarely related to self-competence. Differences -
   especially regarding the extent to which professional and social
   competences were addressed in the meetings - can be found between the
   two examined groups of students and in different learning settings. The
   results allow a deeper understanding of the competences students address
   in their team meetings in research-based projects with a learning
   factory, and therefore, the competences they can acquire while
   completing the project. The results further provide the opportunity to
   continue adapting competence-based teaching concepts at learning
   factories in higher education. (C) 2019 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {The integration of video-based pedagogical tools into educational
   practices has become a prevalent approach. However, the effective
   utilization of video teaching in the context of additive manufacturing
   education presents unique challenges, primarily arising from the
   traditional physical educational practice involving equipment and
   machinery. In this research, a learning factory design blending online
   education and a physical workshop has been tested to see how to deliver
   learning about a full additive manufacturing process chain to full-time
   industrial employees using digital learning technologies, formats and
   methods. The learning factory aimed at giving access to content and
   learning outside of the classroom and at the users' convenience. However
   self-learning modules especially designed for single participants calls
   for a greater attention on how to ensure intrinsic and extrinsic
   motivation. In this study interactive videos were used as primary
   teaching tool. Quizzes and discussion forum were enabled to boost
   intrinsic motivation (instruct active viewing) for the participants to
   complete the videos. After video teaching, physical workshops were
   offered to the participants to assure learning effect as well as an
   extrinsic motivation for the video watching. Statistics based on the
   viewer engagements show that short videos perform better in keeping
   full-time employees engaged. The study indicates that further research
   on the role of interactive videos to secure intrinsic and extrinsic
   self-learning motivation is a promising field in learning factories
   studies.},

Abstract = {Background With their demanding schedules, surgical residents have
   limited time to practice techniques. The aim is to evaluate the
   pedagogic model of self-directed learning using video in surgery
   residents. Methods Informed consent was obtained from all the
   participants. A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2018 at
   Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont (University of Montreal). Participants were
   general surgery residents. There were 27 eligible residents; 22
   completed the study. They were filmed performing an intestinal
   anastomosis on cadaveric pig bowel. The self-directed learning by video
   (SDL-V) group was given an expert video, which demonstrated the
   technique performed by an experienced surgeon. The control group
   continued with their regular duties. Three weeks later, participants
   performed a second filmed anastomosis. Two attending surgeons evaluated
   the residents' filmed anastomosis using the Objective Structured
   Assessment of Technical Skills scale. After their second anastomosis,
   all participants had access to the expert video and completed a survey.
   Results Score did not differ significantly between groups during the
   first (control: 23.6 (4.5) vs. SDL-V: 23.9 (4.5), p = 0.99, presented as
   mean (SD)) or second filmed anastomosis procedure (control: 27.1 (3.9)
   vs. SDL-V: 29.6 (3.4) p = 0.28). Both groups improved significantly from
   pre- to post-intervention (mean difference between the two anastomosis
   procedure with 95\% CI for control: 3.5, {[}1.1; 5.9] and for SDL-V:
   5.8, {[}3.4: 8.2]). Correlation between the evaluators for score was
   moderate (r = 0.6, 95\% CI: {[}0.3: 0.8]). The pass/fail global
   evaluation exhibited poor inter-rater reliability (Kappa: 0.105, 95\%
   CI: {[}- 0.2:0.4]). On the survey, all participants wanted more
   expert-made videos of specific surgical techniques. Conclusions Despite
   a higher final OSATS score for the intervention group, self-directed
   learning by video failed to produce a statistically significant
   difference on the overall OSATS scores between the two groups in this
   small cohort.},

Abstract = {While studies have indicated that visual feedback promotes skill
   acquisition and motor learning in controlled settings and for various
   sports, less is known about its feasibility in physical education, which
   has specific needs and conditions. For this reason, a systematic
   literature review was conducted regarding video-based visual feedback in
   physical education. Out of 2030 initially examined studies, 11 matched
   the selection and quality criteria. The goal was to determine whether
   visual feedback can be effective regarding motor learning in physical
   education in primary and secondary schools, and to investigate whether
   different visual feedback variants (expert modeling and self-modeling),
   supported by verbal feedback, are more effective than verbal feedback
   alone. Subsequently, the different conditions (e.g., age, group size,
   duration) of the included studies were evaluated for their suitability
   for everyday applications. Video-based visual feedback seems to be
   effective to enhance motor learning in physical education and seems to
   be more effective than solely verbal feedback. However, the results show
   that the specific conditions (class size, scheduled lessons, available
   time, technical equipment, the digital literacy of teachers, and data
   protection) of a school environment must be considered before
   implementing visual video feedback in daily practice.},

Abstract = {Flipping the classroom (FTC) is a didactical approach aimed at letting
   students come to class prepared and apply the learning material actively
   during class. As FTC places a higher demand on students' self-regulated
   learning (SRL) skills, our goal in the current study was to research the
   effects of SRL support in a flipped classroom on students' SRL
   (self-reports and online activities) and learning outcomes. Previous
   research showed that video embedded SRL prompts enhances students' SRL
   and learning outcomes. We measured the effects of SRL prompts with a
   quasi-experimental design in six flipped History classrooms in secondary
   education where 154 students were randomly assigned to the SRL prompts
   or no SRL prompt condition. We found positive effects of the SRL prompts
   for the completion rate of the instructional videos (i.e., students in
   the SRL prompts condition watched more videos), but not for other
   indicators of SRL or learning outcomes. Thus, in contrast to previous
   research from higher education, our results show that implementing SRL
   prompts in a flipped classroom is not directly effective in secondary
   education. We address potential explanations for the absence of effects
   of the SRL prompts for theory and practice into SRL support in flipped
   classrooms.},

Abstract = {Online videos have been considered an instructional media for various
   pedagogic and training approaches, such as the flipped classroom and
   open online courses. Video-based learning (VBL) has gained prominence by
   extending the opportunities for education of all socioeconomic levels
   and by removing geographical boundaries and time constraints. Despite
   the great potential of VBL and its promising early outcomes, little is
   known about what influences individuals to adopt video technologies.
   Building on adoption acceptance theories and on empirical e-learning
   studies, we propose an adoption model for VBL consisting of five
   independent factors and one dependent (behavioral intention to adopt
   VBL) factor. A survey of 260 learners, who have used instructional
   videos in the past six months, was used to measure their behavioral
   intention to adopt VBL and what aspects enable or inhibit use. The
   five-predictor model accounts for 74 \% of explained variance in
   students' intention to adopt VBL. In particular, results indicate that
   performance expectancy and computer self-efficacy have a positive effect
   on behavioral intention to adopt VBL. Additionally, effort expectancy
   and social influence positively impact performance expectancy, while
   computer self-efficacy is found to enhance effort expectancy and
   perceived behavioral control.},

Abstract = {Teachers' evaluation policy has become one of the key components of the
   Mexican education reform. As a consequence of these changes, school
   teachers face a new and difficult challenge, since they are required to
   fulfill stricter criteria and maintain their teaching standards at a
   higher level than in previous years. For this reason, new strategies
   need to be adopted in order to answer to this demand. The ability of
   self-reflection has been considered by many authors as one of the key
   factors that can positively affect the overall teaching-learning process
   in both pre-interactive and interactive phases. Video annotation tools
   can provide educators with essential data that can be used to scaffold
   and support teachers' reflection. Thus, the aim of our study is to
   analyze the ability of selfreflection in terms of noticing and
   knowledge-based reasoning processes in teachers of English as a second
   language using a video annotation tool.},

Abstract = {Videos are an engaging medium for learning as they provide affordances
   beyond text or audio-only, thereby allowing the creator more flexibility
   for content generation. Easy access to videos on the Web and their
   popularity within everyday discourse has made them an accepted medium
   for teaching and learning. However, this increase in the availability of
   videos makes it challenging for an instructor, teacher, or learner to
   assess their viability for learning. Each search can lead to thousands
   of videos on a given topic. Although content platforms and search
   engines use a range of data and algorithms for the recommendation, these
   are not tailored to recommend video content specifically for learning.
   In this paper, we present and test a theoretically motivated model to
   rate videos on their potential to support learning goals. Visual Appeal,
   Understanding of Content, Engagement with Topic, and Recommendation
   Preference (VUER) are the four components of our proposed model. We
   assess the model on two content areas, Big Data and Augmented Reality,
   using videos from the TED (Technology, Entertainment, and Design)
   platform. Using crowdsourcing, we collect ratings for items in the VUER
   model and assess effectiveness through the correlation between 1) model
   elements and self-reported learning and 2) the rank of a video in the
   TED search and self-reported learning. Results show that the VUER model
   ratings of videos strongly correlate with the expected learning gain of
   the users for videos on both topics. The expected learner ranking and
   observed TED ranking of videos do not necessarily align, suggesting that
   the ranking on platforms such as TED is not a direct fit to judge the
   teachability of the video content. Thus, there is a need to create
   personalized systems to support online video curation tasks for learners
   and teachers.},

Title = {Is self-explanation better than explaining to a fictitious student when
   learning from video lectures?},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Generating written explanations is a popular learning strategy in an
   online learning environment. Students can explain to themselves (ie,
   self-explanations) or a peer-student (ie, instructional explanations).
   However, for improving learning from video lectures, it is unclear
   whether writing self-explanations is more beneficial than writing
   instructional explanations, and whether writing both types of
   explanation is more beneficial than writing only one type. We compared
   the learning-related outcomes of students who wrote explanations under
   one of four conditions: self-explanation (n = 30), instructional
   explanation (n = 30), self-explanation then instructional explanation (n
   = 30) and instructional explanation then self-explanation (n = 30). We
   assessed the participants' external and internal attention, explanation
   quality, and immediate and delayed learning performance. Students in the
   conditions that included self-explanations showed higher internal
   attention, as well as better immediate and delayed performance than
   those in the instructional explanations condition. In addition, students
   in the two combined conditions showed a higher level of organization and
   elaboration than those in the instructional explanations condition.
   These results suggest that students should write explanations to
   themselves while learning from video lectures. Practitioner notes What
   is already known about this topic Generating explanations is a
   beneficial learning strategy. It is unclear whether explaining to
   oneself (self-explanations) is more beneficial than explaining to a peer
   (instructional explanations). The benefits of writing instructional
   explanations on learning performance were not consistently found across
   diverse areas. What this paper adds Self-explanations, both in oral and
   written form, were more effective for learning performance than
   instructional explanations. Students in the conditions that included
   both self-explanations and instructional explanations demonstrated a
   higher level of organization and elaboration than those in the
   instructional explanation condition. When compared to the
   self-explanations condition, additional instructional explanations had
   no effect on learning performance or internal attention. Implications
   for practice and/or policy Self-explanations was an excellent approach
   for learning from video lectures. Students should write explanations to
   themselves while learning from video lectures.},

Abstract = {This study aimed at assessing the impact of video modeling examples
   (VMEs) on secondary school students' self-regulated learning experiences
   in gymnastics in original physical education (PE) settings. A total of
   56 students (28 males and 28 females), aged 16-17, took part in a
   seven-week gymnastics learning unit for the purpose of acquiring new
   motor skills and knowledge using VMEs, in the absence of teacher and
   peer assistance. Repeated measurements were collected through gymnastics
   floor routines and a custom-designed written test. Semi-structured
   interviews were administered to explore students' self-regulated
   learning strategies. The analysis of quantitative data revealed
   significant improvements in males' skill performance (pre: 4.54 +/-
   2.42, post: 10.97 +/- 3.25 points; p < 0.001) and knowledge (pre: 6.43
   +/- 2.26, post: 13.19 +/- 3.09 points; p < 0.001), as well as females'
   skill performance (pre: 2.64 +/- 2.09, post: 8.96 +/- 4.12 points; p <
   0.001) and knowledge (pre: 6.14 +/- 2.48, post: 10.97 +/- 3.25 points; p
   < 0.001) after taking part in the practical intervention. Sex-based
   differences, in favor of the males, were only observed in knowledge
   outcomes (males: Delta (Delta\%) = 6.76 (105.1\%), females: Delta
   (Delta\%) = 4.25 (69.2\%); p < 0.05). Qualitative data analysis yielded
   three major learning strategies: repeated viewing and interpretation of
   VMEs, self-talk and mental rehearsal. In conclusion, VMEs were able to
   empower the participating students to acquire motor skills and knowledge
   in PE classes through activating different metacognitive learning
   strategies, and even without resorting to teacher/peer assistance. Data
   from this study could prompt PE teachers to incorporate VME-mediated
   self-regulated learning methods into their teaching practices for better
   classroom management and for improving their students' metacognition.},

Abstract = {The aim was to investigate how a reflective tool, the T-CoRe, in
   combination with annotated self-recorded videos and reflective writing,
   could be used to capture student teachers' knowledge of digital
   technology use in their teaching. The authors used both a quantitative
   and a qualitative method to explore how 87 secondary science student
   teachers demonstrate their use of digital technologies in their
   teaching. The student teachers' video annotations, alongside a written
   reflection of critical incidents in their teaching, constituted data for
   the analysis. The analysis identified technology knowledge-dependent
   components in relation to the TPACK framework. The outcomes suggest that
   providing student teachers with a reflective tool such as the T-CoRe in
   combination with annotated self-recorded videos has the potential to
   make visible aspects of their TPACK. This research proposes a method for
   teacher education that works to improve the way that student teachers
   are prepared for using digital technology.},

Abstract = {The paper investigates how the use of visualisations and video
   productions combined with peer-feedback sessions can create exploratory
   approaches to game design in online teaching. Thus, the paper aims to
   provide insights into the iterative learning processes of developing
   games in online game based learning. The empirical data is based on an
   explorative case study where master students from the international
   Nordic Visual Studies and Art Education (NoVA) design games as a part of
   an online game-based learning course. Throughout the course the students
   were situated at three different universities in Finland, Sweden and
   Denmark, collaborating cross-cultural across campuses. The purpose of
   the study was to explore how to establish an online space for joint
   design inquiry in the context of games for changes across cultural and
   professional barriers. The data used for analysis is teaching
   observations, videos of play sessions, students' reflection papers,
   written and oral evaluation with participants after completion of the
   course. The analysis is based on different PBL activities; lectures,
   video tutorials, presentation- and feedback sessions, reflexive
   exercises and students' self-directed design processes and learning in
   groups. Game theory and exercises were presented through videos and
   visuals to support the students' iterative processes of developing
   games. Analysis of the PBL activities show how teachers' video tutorials
   relating theoretical game concepts to the students' group work supported
   their entrance in the game field as well as their design processes. How
   to balance feedback-related video tutorials and teachers' time for
   preparation is identified as a relevant issue for further exploration in
   online game-based teaching. Findings show how the students'
   visualisations and video productions exemplifying game situations,
   created a visible reference point for further discussions in the
   feedback sessions across campuses, which guided the game development.
   Thus, the combination of inquiry approaches, critical game theory and
   design processes combined with students' visualisations and video
   productions indicates interesting connections for bridging gaps between
   professions, e.g. in art and games.},

   Self-regulation in online video-based environments},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Online learning often requires learners to be self-directed and engaged.
   The present study examined students' self-regulatory behaviors in online
   video-based learning environments. Using an experimental design, this
   study investigated the effects of a newly designed enhanced video
   learning environment, which was designed to support or scaffold
   students' self-regulated or self-directed learning on students' learning
   behaviors and outcomes. In addition, correspondence between students'
   self-regulation strategies in traditional learning environments and
   observed self-regulated learning behaviors in the enhanced video
   environment were examined. A cross-sectional experimental research
   design with systematic random assignment of participants to either the
   control condition (common video) or the experimental condition (enhanced
   video) was utilized. Undergraduate and graduate students participated in
   the study (N = 80). Study results indicate that the newly designed
   enhanced video learning environment was a superior instructional tool
   than the common video learning environment in terms students' learning
   performance. In addition, there was correspondence between graduate
   students' self-reported self-regulation and observed self-regulation,
   with those high on seeking/learning information and managing their
   environment/behavior more likely to engage more in interactive
   note-taking. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Interweaving of self-regulated learning and game-based learning in
   higher education: a review of academic publications from 2009 to 2020},
Journal = {ETR\&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 19},
Abstract = {Researchers have indicated the importance of engaging learners in
   self-regulated learning (SRL) states when situated in game-based
   learning contexts; however, it remains a challenge for both educational
   and educational technology researchers to effectively integrate both. To
   this end, this study investigated how SRL strategies are interwoven with
   game-based learning in higher education by searching the web of science
   database to systematically review the papers published between 2009 and
   2020 in academic journals. The encoded dimensions ranged from the
   primary research purpose to research issues, including application
   domains, research methods, duration of the studies, SRL strategies, game
   types, and game genres. It was found that since 2015, the research
   purposes have become increasingly diverse, with skills acquisition in
   game-based learning being regarded as the most important goal, followed
   by knowledge acquisition and behavior change. Such games took goal
   orientation, peer learning, and regulating as the main SRL strategies,
   which exerted a positive effect on learning performance,
   self-efficacy/confidence, attitudes/effort, satisfaction/interest, and
   learning behavior. Meanwhile, these SRL strategies were well embedded
   into problem-solving, simulation, multi-type, and RPG game types against
   the setting of the real-life-related storyline as the main game genre.
   Since previous studies lacked the systematic application of all SRL
   strategies within a game-based learning environment, they could not
   uncover the dynamic and cyclic processes of SRL in game-based learning
   environments. Hence, this study proposed corresponding suggestions for
   future research issues as a reference for researchers, teachers, and
   decision-makers.},

Abstract = {A good physics education depends on a good, transferable mathematics
   education. A concept for a cross-modular blended learning math course
   developed for the first two semesters of our physics teacher trainee
   study program is introduced. The course covers the important new
   mathematics required for the development of the conceptual understanding
   of the classical experimental physics mechanics and electrodynamics. It
   is based on three pillars: parallelism of the math topics to the physics
   lectures, spiral-curricularity to prior knowledge and high quality
   digitally available interactive materials such as interactive videos,
   formative tests and exercises to foster a self-regulated learning of the
   students in online as well as face-to-face learning environments. The
   blended learning math course and its face-to-face math seminars are
   integrated into the experimental physics modules. Results of surveys
   among the first two cohorts of course participants indicate that the
   design of the math course is well accepted and the interactive videos
   are very well received by the students. Initial tests on the learning
   effectiveness indicate a sufficient development of long term knowledge
   by the students.},

Abstract = {In recent years, several researchers have introduced spherical
   video-based virtual reality (SVVR) into classroom teaching to help
   students learn different subjects. In SVVR learning, learners are
   typically presented with great autonomy over their learning process.
   Therefore, learners should engage in self-regulated strategy (SRS)
   learning in order to successfully study in SVVR. However, learners often
   struggle to self-regulate their learning. Therefore, we implemented a
   SRS intervention in SVVR. In this study, a SVVR environment was
   developed to situate students in art history contexts; moreover, the SRS
   was employed to guide students to improve their performance and to make
   reflections on their own performance. In order to evaluate the proposed
   approach's effectiveness, we carried out an experiment in a university
   art history class. The experiment results reveal more positive effects
   of the SRS-based SVVR approach compared with the non-SRS-based SVVR
   approach in terms of the learners' learning achievements,
   self-regulation, meta-cognitive awareness, as well as self-efficacy. In
   addition, this study specified that this approach would not have an
   effect on students' cognitive load. As a result, the SRS-based SVVR
   approach proposed in the current study was effective in art history
   education.},

Abstract = {Practice makes perfect. However, repeating the same thing over and over
   without reflections, sometimes may do more harm than good. Previously,
   we showed that getting students to video-tape each other's laboratory
   performance could increase their seriousness in doing their work as well
   as making them pay more attention to the details. What's more, the video
   records could also be used by the teacher to share with students more
   about the dos and don'ts. In this study, students were asked not only to
   shoot one another's performance in using aseptic techniques to spread
   plate and have the video submitted for evaluation, instead, they were
   asked to make their own video an educational one. While editing the
   video, students had more chance to reflect on their own performance.
   Besides, these videos were uploaded to the Panopto Video platform, which
   allows all students taking the course to see each other's work. Through
   watching, rating and commenting on others' work, students were
   encouraged to engage in peer teaching and learning. Through these
   exercises, students were trained to do something seriously; we hope
   students would apply the same attitude when learning anything new. Apart
   from laboratory techniques, students' IT skills as well as communication
   skills could also be improved.},

Title = {Consistent Intra-Video Contrastive Learning With Asynchronous Long-Term
   Memory Bank},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON CIRCUITS AND SYSTEMS FOR VIDEO TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {33},
Number = {3},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Unsupervised representation learning for videos has recently achieved
   remarkable performance owing to the effectiveness of contrastive
   learning. Most works on video contrastive learning (VCL) pull all
   snippets from the same video into the same category, even if some of
   them are from different actions, leading to temporal collapse, i.e., the
   snippet representations of a video are invariable with the evolution of
   time. In this paper, we introduce a novel intra-video contrastive
   learning (intra-VCL) that further distinguishes intra-video actions to
   alleviate this issue, which includes an asynchronous long-term memory
   bank (that caches the representations of all snippets of each video) and
   mines an extra positive/negative snippet within a video based on the
   asynchronous long-term memory bank. In addition, since an asynchronous
   long-term memory bank is required for performing intra-VCL and
   asynchronous update of the long-term memory leads to inconsistencies
   when performing contrastive learning, we further propose a consistent
   contrastive module (CCM) to perform consistent intra-VCL. Specifically,
   in the CCM, we propose an intra-video self-attention refinement function
   to reduce the inconsistencies within the asynchronously updated
   representations (of all snippets of each video) in the long-term memory
   and an adaptive loss re-weighting to reduce unreliable self-supervision
   produced by inconsistent contrastive pairs. We call our method as
   consistent intra-VCL. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
   effectiveness of the proposed consistent intra-VCL, which achieves
   state-of-the-art performance on the standard benchmarks of
   self-supervised action recognition, with top-1 accuracies of 64.2\% and
   91.0\% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively.},

Abstract = {Educational videos differ from other teaching and learning technologies
   as they allow the benefit of using visual perception. Video lectures are
   not new to education, however with the use of innovative video
   technologies they can improve academic outcomes and extend the reach of
   education. They may offer extraordinary new experiences for higher
   education institutions (HEI). Through them lecturers can provide
   information and contents to students, and if used creatively, video
   lectures can become a powerful technological tool in education, inside
   and outside classrooms. Inside a classroom it can motivate students and
   improve topics' debate and outside it is a good support for students'
   self-learning. In some cases they can be used to work some subjects
   standing behind, but needed to support actual courses contents, that
   students do not remember (or were not even taught), opening an ``in
   front to the past door{''} that backs students self-study. The
   student-educator dynamic is changing. Students are expecting exceptional
   instruction and educators are expecting students to be more and more
   well informed about subjects from online viewing. This article explores
   some of the potential benefits and challenges associated with the use of
   video lectures in the teaching and learning process at higher education.
   We will also discuss some thoughts and examples for the use of teaching
   materials to enhance student's learning and try to understand how video
   can act as powerful and innovative to enlighten teaching and learning
   (note that unfortunately, sometimes, the opposite is happening).},

Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION LETTERS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {143},

Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of shot-level video summarization,
   which aims at selecting a subset of video shots as a summary to
   represent the original video contents compactly and completely. Most
   existing methods rely on various network architectures to learn a single
   score predictor for shot ranking and selection. Different from these
   methods, we plug network feature learning into a binary neural tree to
   consider multi-path predictions for each shot, thus enabling the shot
   evaluation from different aspects. Due to the hierarchical structure of
   the tree, video shots can be coarse-to-fine encoded by imposing
   self-attention on them along branches, leading to favorable predictions.
   Extensive experiments were conducted on two real-world datasets, and the
   results reveal that the proposed method achieves superior performance in
   comparison with previous state-of-the-art methods. (c) 2020 Elsevier

Title = {Using learning analytics with temporal modeling to uncover the interplay
   of before-class video viewing engagement, motivation, and performance in
   an active learning context},

Abstract = {Video learning is a crucial component in flipped learning related to
   learners' readiness to attend more complex face-to-face activities.
   However, instructors may not know students' preparedness and motivation
   for each class. This study intended to examine the underlying mechanism
   between students' before-class video-viewing engagement and performance.
   We investigated learners' motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled
   motivation) based on self-determination theory and controlled for their
   gender, age, and prior performance. An integrated temporal model was
   built under the dynamic structural equation modeling framework.
   Participants were 118 Taiwanese graduate students (78 females and 40
   males) with a mean age of 26.14 years old. Study findings showed that
   students engage with the video content in a consistent viewing pattern,
   which has a significant relationship with their motivation and academic
   performance from week to week. The frequency of skipping backward was
   negatively associated with controlled motivation, while the frequency of
   pauses was positively associated with autonomous and controlled
   motivation. A high frequency of skipping forward predicted lower
   learning performance. Besides, a higher ratio of skipping backward
   predicted higher controlled motivation. Male students, older students,
   and students with higher prior performance exhibited higher autonomous
   motivation, which was related to better learning performance.
   Understanding these relationships can help educators and instructional
   designers develop more effective strategies for fostering students'
   preparedness, engagement and success in active learning contexts. The
   study findings were discussed considering theoretical advancement and
   practical implications for enhancing personalized and active learning in
   higher education to achieve educational equity.},

Abstract = {Stochastic Frontier Regression Analysis was used to investigate
   strategies and skills that are associated with the minimization of time
   required to achieve proficiency in video games among students in grades
   four and five. Students self-reported their video game play habits,
   including strategies and skills used to become good at the video games
   they play. Results indicated an association between game play time spent
   during vacation weeks and proficiency at the game, but no such
   association existed with game play time during typical weeks when school
   is in session. Several strategies and skills were associated with the
   minimization of time spent to achieve proficiency at the game, while a
   few strategies and skills held a negative association with efficient
   learning in games. Some of the findings paralleled those of prior
   research on formal education. Gender differences, as well as
   implications for games and learning are discussed. (C) 2011 Elsevier

Abstract = {New methods for applying videos for learning are needed in teacher
   education. The videos are especially useful in student teachers'
   construction of action-oriented knowledge. Explication of practice and
   formation of students' action-oriented knowledge are more successful
   when they are guided through reflection. Videos help to situate
   learning, explicate tacit understandings, develop habits of reflection,
   improve self-awareness, integrate theoretical and practical
   understandings, and analyze details of student teachers' own lessons.
   Therefore, a new innovative video learning environment was developed to
   allow student teachers and teacher educators to reflect, widen, share,
   and implement pedagogical practices and knowledge resources related to
   teaching, teacher learning, and supervision. This video learning
   environment enables student teachers to upload short videos about their
   critical incidents that characterize meaningful fragments of their
   classroom practices and interaction with pupils that are especially
   critical and thus useful for learning as teachers. These videos can be
   viewed by all users of the environment or by groups specified by the
   owner of the video. This video learning environment was tested by
   student teachers, their supervising teachers, and university lecturers
   according to the needs of using it for guided reflection in constructing
   action-oriented knowledge. The results of this study showed that the
   learning environment can be applied for student teachers' training. It
   was especially important that all users found this learning environment
   easy to use and safe for presenting and analyzing ethically sensitive
   material. In addition, several recommendations were made to be
   considered in different video learning environments.},

Title = {Question generation type and organizational cues in video learning: A
   study on their effects on online learning behaviors},
Journal = {ACTIVE LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 11},
Abstract = {This study examined the influence of question generation types and
   organizational cues on video learning. Participants were 100
   undergraduate students randomly assigned to view videos that differed in
   terms of question generation type (instructor-generated vs.
   self-generated) and organizational cues (with vs. without). The results
   revealed that self-generated questions led to superior learning
   performance and higher cognitive load compared to instructor-generated
   questions in the absence of organizational cues, but when combined with
   organizational cues, there was no significant difference between the
   instructor and self-generated questions. Additionally, students who
   engaged with self-generated questions demonstrated a higher frequency of
   interaction and seeking behaviors and meta-cognition. Mediation analysis
   further indicated that self-generated questions, compared to
   instructor-generated questions, improved learning performance by
   increasing both the seeking frequency and cognitive load. These findings
   underscore the importance of question generation and organizational cues
   in video learning. They also have practical implications for design and
   use of video learning: if students are required to generate questions by
   themselves, it is better not to provide organizational cues; this will
   foster their engagement (more research behaviors and higher cognitive
   load) and thus their learning. In contrast, if they must answer
   questions generated by the instructor, the presence or absence of
   organizational cues does not matter.},

Abstract = {The primary objectives of this research are to describe the experience
   of implementing e-projects aimed at creating educational videos at
   Kalashnikov Izhevsk State Technical University while training vocational
   educators; to assess the efficacy of the pedagogy and to discuss our
   experience and give recommendations for organizing trainee-students'
   self-study with e-projects aimed at creating educational videos.
   A set of quantitative pre- and post-surveys were administered for
   students in order to evaluate their learning outcomes and competencies
   development. Students' motivation and attitudes were evaluated through
   questionnaires, interviews, and discussions. An expert group appraisal
   method was used to define assessment components.
   The experiment results showed positive dynamics in students' English and
   ICT competency. For most students, the level of their ICT competence
   development after the experiment was diagnosed as `professional'.
   Concerning English skills and vocabulary acquisition, the post-survey
   results showed that all students demonstrated considerable improvements
   in reading and listening skills in their research area. Creating
   educational videos in English obviously contributed to the development
   of students' pronunciation skills as well.
   Interdisciplinary e-projects aimed at creating educational video in
   English proved to be effective for the development of vital professional
   competencies of VE students. The need for setting didactic goals,
   developing scenarios, recording, editing, using animation and
   specialized programs contributes to the development of VE students' ICT
   competency, while searching for information, writing, editing and
   mouthing professionally oriented texts in English provides a sound grasp
   of English skills and vocabulary in the project area. (C) 2018 Published

Title = {Using a self-regulated learning-enhanced video feedback educational
   intervention to improve junior doctor prescribing},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},

Abstract = {Introduction: Medical school graduates in the UK consistently report
   feeling underprepared for the task of prescribing when embarking on
   practice. The effective application of self-regulated learning (SRL)
   approaches and feedback on complex tasks are associated with improved
   outcomes in practice-based clinical skills. Aims: This study aimed to
   investigate the effectiveness of an educational intervention using
   SRL-enhanced video feedback for improving the prescribing competency of
   junior doctors. Methods: A prospective cohort study was designed to
   compare intervention and control cohorts of junior doctors undertaking
   simulated clinical encounters at the beginning and end of their 4-month
   rotation through renal medicine. Results: The improvement in prescribing
   competency for the intervention cohort was significant (p < 0.001) with
   large effect size (d = 1.42). Self-efficacy improved in both cohorts
   with large (control cohort p = 0.026, r= 0.64) and medium (intervention
   cohort p = 0.083, d = 0.55) effect sizes. Goal setting and
   self-monitoring skills improved in the intervention cohort only with
   medium effect size (p = 0.096, d = 0.53). Conclusions: SRL-enhanced
   video feedback is effective for improving prescribing competency and
   developing SRL processes such as goal setting and self-monitoring skills
   in simulated clinical encounters. Further research is required to
   evaluate transferability to other clinical sub-speciality contexts and
   investigate the effectiveness of the intervention for improving
   prescribing in non-simulated settings.},

Title = {Making sense of comments on YouTube educational videos: a self-directed
   learning perspective},
Journal = {ONLINE INFORMATION REVIEW},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {41},
Number = {5},
Pages = {611-625},
Abstract = {Purpose - Through the lens of self-directed theory, the purpose of this
   paper is to investigate if social technologies such as YouTube will be
   viable to disseminate educational instructions and in the process
   empowering learners to take charge of their learning.
   Design/methodology/approach - A total of 150 educational videos on
   YouTube were selected and 29,386 comments extracted using the authors'
   customized extraction software application. Sentiment and qualitative
   content analyses were performed.
   Findings - Results indicate that YouTube can play important roles in
   facilitating online self-directed learning (SDL) as the findings
   uncovered a variety of learning and social affordances of YouTube.
   However, caution should be exercised as high views and well-commented
   videos might not imply quality and credibility. This study concludes
   that YouTube generally provides a conducive a learning environment that
   affords learners the resources to meet their SDL objectives.
   Research limitations/implications - To the best of knowledge, this is
   the first study that investigates SDL in social media by combining both
   qualitative content and sentiment analyses. The study shows that such a
   hybrid approach of combining two diverse analytical techniques provides
   an innovative means to make sense of comments expressed in social media.
   Practical implications - The results will help educational institutions
   and policy-makers to craft better programs for public education and
   create policies to help self-directed learners in evaluating online
   video resources.
   Originality/value - Despite a wealth of literature on the use of
   technologies to support learning, the majority of work done to date has
   dealt in the classroom context. Studies on SDL using educational content
   on YouTube are limited. Hence, this research contributes by providing
   insights on how educational institutions can move toward the direction
   of building collaborative digital learning platforms with relevant
   educational instruction and resources to enable users to participate in
   lifelong self-learning and education.},

Abstract = {As deepfake technology has become increasingly sophisticated and
   accessible, making it easier for individuals with malicious intent to
   create convincing fake content, which has raised considerable concern in
   the multimedia and computer vision community. Despite significant
   advances in deepfake video detection, most existing methods mainly
   focused on model architecture and training processes with little focus
   on data perspectives. In this paper, we argue that data quality has
   become the main bottleneck of current research. To be specific, in the
   pre-training phase, the domain shift between pre-training and target
   datasets may lead to poor generalization ability. Meanwhile, in the
   training phase, the low fidelity of the existing datasets leads to
   detectors relying on specific low-level visual artifacts or
   inconsistency. To overcome the shortcomings, (1). In the pre-training
   phase, pre-train our model on high-quality facial videos by utilizing
   data-efficient reconstruction-based self-supervised learning to solve
   domain shift. (2). In the training phase, we develop a novel
   spatio-temporal generator that can synthesize various high-quality
   ``fake{''} videos in large quantities at a low cost, which enables our
   model to learn more general spatio-temporal representations in a
   self-supervised manner. (3). Additinally, to take full advantage of
   synthetic ``fake{''} videos, we adopt diversity losses at both frame and
   video levels to explore the diversity of clues in ``fake{''} videos. Our
   proposed framework is data-efficient and does not require any real-world
   deepfake videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method
   significantly improves the generalization capability. Particularly on
   the most challenging CDF and DFDC datasets, our method outperforms the
   baselines by 8.88\% and 7.73\% points, respectively. Our code and
   Appendix can be found in github.com/llosta/STC.},

Abstract = {Parasocial relationships (PSRs) or parasocial interactions (PSIs) have
   been extensively researched in the field of marketing and television. As
   a result, we know that viewers form strong relationships with presenters
   and this greatly impacts the product they sell. However, whether this
   effect also impacts learning through educational videos is rarely
   researched. In this study, the correlation between PSI and learning
   growth, as well as learning motivation, was investigated. The results
   showed no correlation between PSI and learning growth, but a slight
   correlation between PSI and learning motivation, especially in the case
   of female participants. This shows potential for the creation of
   educational videos. Simultaneously, the findings are important for the
   training of teachers, because through research on PSI we understand the
   factors that can lead to the improvement of interaction and
   relationships.},

Abstract = {Objectives To develop a self-learning station combining a video with
   computer exercises to learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to
   novices, and to assess the efficacy of these two components on CPR
   acquisition.Methods One hundred and twenty-five pharmacy students were
   trained using learning-while-watching video instructions followed by
   exercises with voice feedback. The proportion of students with adequate
   CPR skills (70\% compressions with depth 50 mm, 70\% compressions with
   complete release <5 mm, a compression rate between 100 and 120/min, 70\%
   ventilations with a volume between 400 and 1000 ml) was measured at
   baseline, after video training and after subsequent voice-feedback
   training.Results Complete datasets were obtained for 104 students. After
   video training, the 70\% cut-off for compression depth was achieved in
   29/104 students, for complete release in 75/104, for ventilation volume
   in 44/104. Mean compression rate 100-120/min was adequate in 77/104
   students. Compared with baseline results, only rate (29/104 vs. 77/104)
   and ventilation volume (6/104 vs. 44/104) improved. After subsequent
   training with voice feedback the proportions were: compression depth
   88/104, compression rate 77/104, ventilation volume 74/104 and complete
   release 90/104. Compared with the skill level after video training only
   compression rate did not further improve. A score combining the three
   compression skills resulted in the following success rates: 6/104
   (baseline), 15/104 (after the video), 59/104 (after voice
   feedback).Conclusion Although in a self-learning station video training
   can introduce CPR skills to novices, additional voice-feedback exercises
   were needed to achieve acceptable CPR quality. (C) 2013 Wolters Kluwer

Abstract = {Preservice teachers (PSTs) often experience professional anxiety when

   combining theoretical lectures and 360-degree videos watched with
   virtual reality headsets, to train their interpersonal competence.
   Participants of this study were 141 first year PSTs of a teacher
   education institute in the Netherlands. Results showed that the
   video-lecture combination led to a reduced professional anxiety and
   increased self-efficacy. PSTs' self-perceptions of their own expected
   interpersonal behaviour indicated that PSTs thought they would be more
   in control in the actual classroom after the intervention. PSTs
   attributed these results to exemplary teacher behaviour shown in the

Abstract = {BackgroundOnline video-based learning is more common in higher
   education. Investigating students' viewing behaviors while watching
   online video lectures is essential for instructors to understand their
   learning status so that the course content, structure, and media
   selection can be improved continuously. The current study identified the
   engagement level of the learners based on their online video-watching
   behaviors, and tested the correlation between the engagement level and
   learning outcome. MethodsThe action logs of watching online video
   lectures in 2020 Spring Pharmacology of the 4th-year medical students of
   the 6-year course and their feedbacks by questionnaires after each exam
   during the semester were provided anonymously. The data were analyzed
   and visualized for an efficient way to comprehend and interpret. To
   define the student's engagement level in his or her video-based learning
   journey, three viewing criteria, ``Completion,{''} ``Pausing,{''} and
   ``Repeated watching{''} were identified. We evaluated the association
   between the engagement level and the students' learning outcomes,
   including their learning satisfaction, knowledge acquisition progresses
   based on assessment results, and the grades measured by the instructors.
   ResultsThe graphs and the charts demonstrate whether the students
   allocated enough time to finish the video lectures (completion), paused
   for a while, then resumed the video (pausing), or replayed the specific
   sections of video content (repeated watching). The engagement level with
   video lectures, evaluated by pre-defined thresholds for
   ``Completion,{''} ``Pausing,{''} and ``Repeated watching{''} had a
   positive correlation with the learning outcomes. ConclusionsWe suggested
   that an engagement dashboard containing real-time visualized information
   on students' online video-watching behaviors can be developed to help
   instructors to monitor students' learning progress and improve teaching
   in a timely fashion. It can also help each student to re-feel the
   stimulation of peers, prompt self-monitoring, improve their learning
   attitudes and disciplines for better learning outcomes. This innovative
   way of assessing student's engagement during online video-based learning
   can also be used for quality assurance purposes.},

Title = {Digital video for fostering self-reflection in an ePortfolio environment},
Journal = {LEARNING MEDIA AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2009},
Volume = {34},
Number = {4},
Pages = {337-350},
Abstract = {The ability to self-reflect is widely recognized as a desirable learner
   attribute that can induce deep learning. Advances in computer-mediated
   communication technologies have led to intense interest in higher
   education in exploring the potential of digital tools, particularly
   digital video, for fostering self-reflection. While there are reports
   pointing to the salutary effects of digital video on learners'
   reflective ability, a systematic inquiry into how digital video can be
   utilized to promote self-reflection in an ePortfolio context remains
   under-reported. In this paper, we pose two questions: (1) Do students
   have the confidence to create their own digital videos for reflection
   and do they find this activity relevant to their learning needs?; and
   (2) To what extent does digital video affect the level of
   self-reflection and the nature of peer feedback? Results from this
   small-scale exploratory case study provide evidence in support of video
   use as a reflective tool in an ePortfolio context and highlight the need
   for considering pedagogical and technological issues that are of
   significance for teachers, educators and ePortfolio developers.},

Title = {Ecological recognition of self-esteem leveraged by video-based gait},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {OCT 10},
Abstract = {Self-esteem is a significant kind of psychological resource, and
   behavioral self-esteem assessments are rare currently. Using ordinary
   cameras to capture one's gait pattern to reveal people's self-esteem
   meets the requirement for real-time population-based assessment. A total
   of 152 healthy students who had no walking issues were recruited as
   participants. The self-esteem scores and gait data were obtained using a
   standard 2D camera and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES). After
   data preprocessing, dynamic gait features were extracted for training
   machine learning models that predicted self-esteem scores based on the
   data. For self-esteem prediction, the best results were achieved by
   Gaussian processes and linear regression, with a correlation of 0.51 (p
   < 0.001), 0.52 (p < 0.001), 0.46 (p < 0.001) for all participants,
   males, and females, respectively. Moreover, the highest reliability was
   0.92 which was achieved by RBF-support vector regression. Gait acquired
   by a 2D camera can predict one's self-esteem quite well. This innovative
   approach is a good supplement to the existing methods in ecological
   recognition of self-esteem leveraged by video-based gait.},

Title = {The effects of self-assessment and supervisor feedback on residents'

Journal = {PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {97},
Number = {1},
Pages = {59-66},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Objectives: To determine the effects of residents' communication
   self-assessment and supervisor feedback on residents'
   communication-competency awareness, on their patient-education
   competency, and on their patients' opinion.
   Methods: The program consisted of the implementation of a communication
   self-assessment and feedback process using videoed outpatient
   consultations (video-CAF). Residents wrote down communication learning
   objectives during the instruction and after each video-CAF session.
   Residents' patient-education competency was assessed by trained raters,
   using the CELI instrument. Participating patients completed a
   questionnaire about the contact with their physician.
   Results: Forty-four residents and 21 supervisors participated in 87
   video-CAF sessions. After their first video-CAF session, residents wrote
   down more learning objectives addressing their control and rapport
   skills and their listening skills. Video-CAF participation improved
   residents' patient-education competency, but only in their control and
   rapport skills. Video-CAF participation had no effect on patients'
   opinion.
   Conclusions: Video-CAF appears to be a feasible procedure and might be
   effective in improving residents' patient-education competency in
   clinical practice.
   Practice implications: Video-CAF could fill the existing deficiency of
   communication training in residency programs. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ireland

Abstract = {In the current study, we examine the role of situation-specific
   motivational profiles in the effectiveness of video modeling examples
   for learning problem-solving and self-assessment accuracy in the domain
   of biology. A sample of 342 secondary school students participated in
   our study. Latent profile analysis resulted in four motivational
   profiles: (a) good-quality profile (high autonomous motivation, moderate
   introjected and external motivation), (b) moderately positive profile
   (moderate motivation levels with relatively higher autonomous
   motivation), (c) moderately negative profile (moderate motivation levels
   with relatively higher external motivation), and (d) poor-quality
   profile (moderate external, low autonomous motivation). Findings showed
   students with good-quality or moderately positive profiles learned more
   from the video modeling in terms of problem-solving and self-assessment
   accuracy than students with poor-quality or moderately negative
   profiles. Furthermore, students with a moderately negative profile
   outperformed students with a poor-quality profile on problem-solving and
   self-assessment accuracy. Results further indicated that students with
   good-quality and moderately positive profiles experienced studying the
   video modeling examples as less effortful than students with
   poor-quality or moderately negative profiles. Overall, our results
   demonstrated that knowing about students' motivational profiles could
   help explain differences in how well students learn problem-solving as
   well as self-assessment skills from watching video modeling examples.},

Title = {360° Video as a learning tool for filmmaking},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 15},
Abstract = {Filmmaking is an inherently practical area of study. Not all students
   can access film school because of monetary, location and health issues.
   Options without schooling are online in the form of tutorial videos. 360
   degrees video offers a more interactive approach than traditional
   learning tools, and the technology can enhance learning and promote
   self-guided learning. Using constructivist grounded theory methodology
   through cyclic testing of mixed method data collection via six
   participant survey rounds, 360 degrees video content was created and
   hosted on the online hub www.filmschool360.com (
   https://dmillea2662.Wixsite.com/framework/). A technical workflow was
   developed to show that 360 degrees technology can aid practical
   filmmaking study. Filmmaking students, alumni, academics, technical
   staff, and professionals tested the videos and found them to be
   interesting, informative, and immersive. Audio, direction, and video
   elements were found to be important. One 360 degrees video has the
   potential for freedom of learning through unique viewpoints while
   reducing creator costs. Short five-minute videos can provide an
   accessible learning method for those with disabilities, with no barriers
   towards gender or ethnicity. The freedom to navigate the videos empowers
   the learner, enhancing their self-guided learning skills. The bridge
   between traditional and online learning can be opened using 360 degrees
   video.},

Title = {Distractions when viewing in-hospital heart failure self-care videos and
   change in heart failure self-care knowledge},
Journal = {HEART \& LUNG},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {53},
Pages = {67-71},
Month = {MAY-JUN},
Abstract = {Background: When viewing in-hospital heart failure (HF) education
   videos, internal and external distractions could interfere with
   understanding of educational content.
   Objective: To examine if distractions when learning are associated with
   HF knowledge.
   Methods: HF self-care knowledge was assessed using a validated HF
   knowledge instrument. Research nurses recorded distractions during video
   viewing. Patient characteristics were retrieved from a database.
   Demographics and change in knowledge scores were compared overall and by
   distraction groups using comparative statistics.
   Results: Among all 60 participants, distractions were not associated
   with patient characteristics. Pre- and post-video education, HF
   standardized knowledge scores were 72.5 +/- 10.7 and 77.7 +/- 10.5
   respectively, p<0.001 and 5 (of 20) item scores increased post-video
   viewing. HF self-care knowledge scores were not associated with
   distraction frequency, but scores were highest in patients without
   internal distractions (p = 0.025).
   Conclusion: In-hospital video education was associated with higher HF
   knowledge despite internal (primarily fatigue) or external (primarily
   nursing caregiver interruption) distractions. (C) 2022 Elsevier Inc. All

Abstract = {Learning in the present times has required not only advanced technology
   but the use of technology that aids in promoting learning that is both
   engaging and self-paced with a balanced mix of tempo and experience.
   This Research to Practice Work-in-Progress study involves interactive
   video enhanced tutorials (IVETs) that were developed as part of an
   ongoing NSF funded project to promote problem-solving in physics. IVETs
   are short, web-based activities taking students 10-15 minutes to
   complete. In this WIP paper, the researchers focus on a cross-section of
   the work that is part of the ongoing study and report impact of teaching
   problem-solving in the context of three groups namely, IVET group,
   video-only group, and no treatment group. The students are all
   engineering majors enrolled in a first-semester calculus-based physics
   course. Impact was also analyzed in relation to student demographics,
   with subgroups including women and under-represented minorities. This
   research study employs quantitative (demographic, follow-up problem) and
   qualitative data (student artifacts), along with mixed methods analysis
   to report the emerging results.
   IVETs are an innovative genus of teaching-learning tools that are
   expected to meet the needs and challenges of the current learning
   environment to engage students, while focusing on the development of
   core discipline-specific skills, and extend the learning of engineering
   and science students through deliberate problem-solving practice.
   Additionally, IVETs are a tool that can have useful implications in
   transforming learning in other STEM disciplines through
   multidisciplinary convergence via integration to retain undergraduates
   in engineering and other disciplines of STEM.},

Title = {Digital learning designs in physiotherapy education: a systematic review
   and meta-analysis},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 13},
Abstract = {Background: Digital learning designs have the potential to support
   teaching and learning within higher education. However, the research on
   digital learning designs within physiotherapy education is limited. This
   study aims to identify and investigate the effectiveness of digital
   learning designs in physiotherapy education.
   Methods: The study was designed as a systematic review and meta-analysis
   of randomized and non-randomized trials. A search of eight databases on
   digital learning designs and technology was conducted. Study selection,
   methodology and quality assessment were performed independently by three
   reviewers. The included studies were mapped according to the types of
   digital interventions and studies. For similar interventions, the
   learning effects were calculated using meta-analyses.
   Results: Altogether, 22 studies were included in the review (17
   randomized controlled trials and five cohort studies). A blended
   learning design was used in 21 studies, a flipped classroom model in
   five and a distance learning design in one. Altogether, 10 of the 22
   articles were included in meta-analyses, which showed statistically
   significant effects for flipped classrooms on knowledge acquisition
   (standardized mean difference {[}SMD]: 0.41; 95\% confidence interval
   {[}CI]: 0.20, 0.62), for interactive websites or applications (apps) on
   practical skills (SMD: 1.07; 95\% CI: 0.71,1.43) and for students
   self-produced videos on a practical skill in a cervical spine scenario
   (SMD: 0.49; 95\% CI: 0.06, 0.93). Overall, the effects indicated that
   blended learning designs are equally as or more effective than
   traditional classroom teaching to achieve learning outcomes. Distance
   learning showed no significant differences compared to traditional
   classroom teaching.
   Conclusions: The current findings from physiotherapy education indicate
   that digital learning designs in the form of blended learning and
   distance learning were equally or more effective compared to traditional
   teaching. The meta-analyses revealed significant effects on student
   learning in favour of the interventions using flipped classrooms,
   interactive websites/apps and students self-produced videos. However,
   these results must be confirmed in larger controlled trials. Further,
   research should investigate how digital learning designs can facilitate
   students' learning of practical skills and behaviour, learning retention
   and approaches to studying as well as references for teaching and
   learning in digital learning environments.},

Volume = {17},

Abstract = {Understanding how students perceive and adopt technology in their daily
   life is particularly relevant to today's Information and Communication
   Technology (ICT) environment, in which versatile ICT tools are becoming
   more and more pervasive, almost ubiquitous in our day-to-day activities.
   In the context of English as a foreign language, this study investigates
   how Chinese students produce an English video with over-the-counter
   technology tools for accomplishing a language-learning task. In
   particular, this study probes into how youngsters today respond to a
   given learning task, how and why they adopt technology tools available
   and of use to them for the task. Data collection is through observation,
   students' reports, and interviews. The focus on specific case study
   settings offers a closer look at how the use of technology tools is
   socially and technologically shaped in each individual case. Students
   reported that they welcomed and valued such learning experience and had
   in general positive attitude toward the tools and their use in learning.
   The results reveal students' willingness and capability in adopting
   technology tools, whether familiar or unfamiliar to them, and
   appropriating these tools to fulfill their individual leaning needs.
   Implications have been drawn to provide a new aspect of technology
   adoption in school learning.},

Abstract = {Videos can be used as didactic tools for self-learning under several
   circumstances, including those cases in which students are responsible
   for the development of this resource as an audiovisual notebook. We
   compared students' and teachers' perceptions regarding the main features
   that an audiovisual notebook should include. Four questionnaires with
   items about information, images, text and music, and filmmaking were
   used to investigate students' (n=115) and teachers' perceptions (n=28)
   regarding the development of a video focused on a histological
   technique. The results show that both students and teachers
   significantly prioritize informative components, images and filmmaking
   more than text and music. The scores were significantly higher for
   teachers than for students for all four components analyzed. The highest
   scores were given to items related to practical and medically oriented
   elements, and the lowest values were given to theoretical and
   complementary elements. For most items, there were no differences
   between genders. A strong positive correlation was found between the
   scores given to each item by teachers and students. These results show
   that both students' and teachers' perceptions tend to coincide for most
   items, and suggest that audiovisual notebooks developed by students
   would emphasize the same items as those perceived by teachers to be the
   most relevant. Further, these findings suggest that the use of video as
   an audiovisual learning notebook would not only preserve the curricular
   objectives but would also offer the advantages of self-learning
   processes. Anat Sci Educ 7: 209-218. (c) 2013 American Association of

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of different
   types of cues and self-explanation prompts in instructional videos on
   intrinsic motivation, learning engagement, learning outcomes, and
   cognitive load, which were indicators to measure deep learning
   performance. Seventy-two college students were randomly assigned to one
   of the six conditions in a 3 x 2 factorial design with cues (visual vs.
   textual vs. combined textual-\&-visual) and self-explanation prompts
   (prediction vs. reflection) as the between-subjects factors. To measure
   participants' learning engagement, Neurosky mindwave mobile and Tobii
   pro X3-120 eye-tracker were used to collect their brain wave data and
   eye movement data, respectively. Learning outcomes were measured with
   retention and transfer tests, and questionnaires were used to measure
   participants' intrinsic motivation and cognitive load, respectively. The
   results revealed that the textual cues significantly facilitated
   learning outcomes and learning engagement-attention-while the reflection
   prompts significantly affected learning engagement-the mean fixation
   duration-and cognitive load. Notably, the combination of textual cues
   and reflection prompts and the combination of visual cues and prediction
   prompts allowed the participants to focus and engage in the video
   learning process more deeply, resulting in a significantly higher
   learning outcome than their peers from other conditions. This research
   could provide some implications for designing short instructional videos
   to facilitate deep learning.},

Title = {The importance of aligning instructor age with learning content in
   designing instructional videos for older adults},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 SEP 19},
Abstract = {With the increase in life expectancy and the rapid advancement of
   digital technology, older adults often face challenges where formal
   learning opportunities are scarce. Consequently, they are compelled to
   rely on instructional videos for continuous learning. However, many
   older adults struggle with low self-efficacy and motivation. Although
   previous studies on instructional videos have investigated how the
   design of video lectures can promote learners' self-efficacy, these
   studies predominantly focus on young populations. The present study aims
   to test the interaction effects of a lecturer's age (young vs. older
   adults) and the type of learning content (Traditional Chinese Medicine
   (TCM) health preservation vs. digital technology) in instructional
   videos. The results indicated that in instructional video lectures on
   TCM health preservation, older adults demonstrated better learning
   performance when instructed by an older lecturer compared to a young
   one. Conversely, in instructional video lectures on digital technology,
   older adults exhibited better learning performance, higher motivation,
   and greater activation in FEFs, dlPFC, and SMC, when instructed by a
   young lecturer compared to an older one. Our findings have significant
   implications for the design of instructional videos for older adults.},

Title = {TECHNOLOGY OF SELF-DETERMINED LEARNING AS A NEW FORMAT OF CONTINUING
   PROFESSIONAL EDUCATION OF TEACHERS},
Journal = {OBRAZOVANIE I NAUKA-EDUCATION AND SCIENCE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {21},

Abstract = {Introduction. Continuing professional education (CPE) is a strategic
   resource of cardinal transformations, which are currently taking place
   in edu-cation. The essence of such transformations generally consists in
   necessary rejection of a subject-information learning model and
   transition to designing the model of vocational self-development and
   self-determination.
   The aim of this research was to reveal the essence of teachers'
   professional development as the process of positional self-determination
   and formation of managerial position. The hypothesis of the study
   consists in the assumption that the technology of self-determined
   learning is the institutional form of mastering and implementing the
   practice of CPE for teachers as a practice of human potential
   development in the professional and anthropological self-determination
   of an adult learner.
   Methodology and research methods. The methodological basis of the study
   was the comparative educational strategy of CPE, which is embodied in
   the model of self-determined adult education, focused on the formation
   of the human ability to manage their own development in an unstable
   world through the development of new types of cultural thinking and
   behaviour. The methods of research of teachers' management position
   included the system of the following initiatives: interviews, results of
   group reflections, content-analysis, methods of included observation
   using video recording of training sessions and educational products.
   Results and scientific novelty. The complex of diagnostic technologies
   allowed the authors to establish management positions of teachers
   (implementer, leader or strategist) and their ability to design the
   paths of own development and to organise the system of managerial
   challenges. As the most adequate technological scheme of self-determined
   learning, the authors tested the mechanism of project-resource
   management, which regulates the learner's movement in the educational
   space from actions carried out in a particular situation in accordance
   with the circumstances to an activity determined by a local goal, then
   to the reflection of own activity elevating to the status of a new norm,
   and, finally, to the reflection of changes in their own position. It was
   established that the developmental trajectory of human potential in
   professiogenesis starts from mastering the subject and means of activity
   (implementer) and passes through building up funds in transforming a
   special subject of activity (leader) towards designing new standards of
   means and subject of activity (strategist).
   The authors introduce the concept of ``anthropological
   self-determination of an adult in the educational process{''} as the
   process and the result of formation of own managerial position and
   development of a new identity in changing life circumstances.
   Practical significance of the present research is determined by the
   possibility of designing educational programmes, which ensure
   co-organisation of adult students in a single event-activity space based
   on the mechanisms of project-resource management through the system of
   managerial challenges.},

   tasks in teacher training could be planned more effectively. One hundred
   thirty-six teacher education students carrying out their teaching
   practicum participated in the study. Data was collected via a
   questionnaire after the teaching practicum (practical teaching course).
   The answers to the open questions were analyzed using the qualitative
   content analysis method, and the results of the answers to the closed
   questions are described using frequency indicators. The results show
   that the teacher education students who participated in the study
   expressed neutral opinions and positive expectations, as well as
   hesitation, uncertainty, discomfort, and fear before the first-time
   recording of their lesson and its analysis. For most of the study
   participants, the experience of recording and analyzing their lesson and
   observing a fellow student's lesson video was helpful and increased
   their self-confidence. The discussion highlights the possibilities of
   making the experience of video reflection more supportive and useful for
   teacher education students.},

Abstract = {While written and audio feedback have been well-examined by researchers,
   video feedback has received less attention. This review establishes the
   current state of research into video feedback encompassing three
   formats: talking head, screencast and combination screencast. Existing
   research shows that video feedback has a high level of acceptability
   amongst both staff and students and may help strengthen student-marker
   relationships; however, the impact of video feedback on student learning
   outcomes is yet to be determined. In addition, current evidence is drawn
   largely from small-scale studies and self-reported data susceptible to
   the novelty effect. While video feedback appears to be a promising
   alternative to traditional written feedback for its relative relational
   richness, the medium continues to be primarily used for information
   transmission rather than dialogue. Further research is needed to
   establish how the medium of video influences the feedback process, its
   potential to facilitate dialogue and its effects on student learning.},

Abstract = {The ubiquity of mobile devices with internet access and social networks
   has transformed the way people consume information. Individuals stay
   connected to platforms for instant communication and sharing of concise
   messages and videos, which have increased the expectation for
   objectivity on any offered content. However, this objectivity has been
   poorly explored in the production of educational content. Aiming to
   supply this demand, this work proposes a novel online video model to be
   used in the continuing education of IT professionals. A five-stage
   process, composed of empathy, definition, ideation, prototype, and
   tests, has been adopted according to the Design Thinking methodology.
   All stages were focused on knowing the users' needs in order to create
   the video format that satisfies their expectations. The video prototype
   was sent to a group of 150 people together with an online
   self-assessment survey whose results were used to confirm the
   methodology effectiveness by applying a Wilcoxon non-parametric test.
   The proposed model was able to create satisfactory learning outcomes in
   80.30\% of the participants and, according to the results of the
   statistical analysis performed, the video model proved itself efficient
   in the development of practice and application-level skills.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the use of interactive, branched videos compared
   with traditional passive linear delivery for enhancing student
   engagement and learning in online courses. Undergraduate biology
   students were provided with either branched decision-based or linear
   videos on cell biology and protein purification as self-guided or
   consolidation activities. While the interactive branched videos did not
   improve learning gains, thematic analysis revealed that students found
   them more enjoyable and preferable for revision. However, most students
   felt linear passive videos were more logically structured for core
   content delivery. In a revised format, with clearer scaffolding, the
   interactive branched videos were perceived as significantly more
   engaging and useful when utilised for a problem-solving activity.
   Students welcomed the autonomy of directing their learning path but
   desired support to avoid missing critical information. Overall,
   thoughtfully designed branched videos can increase student motivation,
   but their utility depends on context. Our findings indicate the
   importance of balancing interactivity, clear organisation and purpose
   when incorporating these innovative formats into online learning.
   Branched videos show promise for increasing engagement but require
   intentional instructional design tailored to learning objectives.
   Here, the potential of interactive, branched-based videos in online
   biology courses is evaluated. Although not directly enhancing learning
   gains, these videos are shown to be engaging and are ideal for revision.
   When properly scaffolded, they excel in engaging students in
   problem-solving tasks. A balance of interactivity, organisation and
   design of such innovative formats can enrich online learning
   experiences.image},

Volume = {11},
Number = {5},

Month = {SEP-OCT},
Abstract = {Allied health professionals concur that a sound knowledge of practical
   gross anatomy is vital for the clinician, however, human anatomy courses
   in allied health programs have been identified as high-risk for
   attrition and failure. While anatomists and clinicians agree that
   learning anatomy via human cadaveric instruction is the preferred
   method, students vary in their reaction to the cadaveric learning
   experience and have differing levels of anatomy self-efficacy. This
   study investigated whether student self-efficacy had an effect on
   student usage of supplemental instructional videos and whether the use
   of videos had an impact on student self-efficacy and/or learning.
   Anatomy self-efficacy differed based on gender and prior performance.
   Student usage of the videos varied widely and students with lower
   self-efficacy were more inclined to use the resources. The provision of
   the videos did not improve overall cohort performance as compared to a
   historical cohort, however, those students that accessed all video sets
   experienced a greater normalized learning gain compared to students that
   used none or one of the four sets of videos. Student reports and usage
   patterns indicate that the videos were primarily used for practical
   class preparation and revision. Potentially, the videos represent a
   passive mode of teaching whereas active learning has been demonstrated
   to result in greater learning gains. Adapting the videos into
   interactive tutorials which will provide opportunity for feedback and
   the development of students' self-evaluation may be more appropriate.

Title = {A video- and feedback-based approach to teaching communication skills in
   undergraduate clinical dental education: The student perspective},
Journal = {EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {26},
Number = {1},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective Student evaluation of a communication-education programme that
   combined patient consultation videos with peer- or expert-based
   feedback.
   Methods A self-perception questionnaire was given to undergraduate
   dental students who had undertaken a curricular communication training
   and feedback programme, in which each participant was videoed three
   times during a patient interview or consultation, subsequently receiving
   either peer (PG) or expert feedback (EG). The questionnaire used
   feedback programme content to evaluate student perspectives,
   ascertaining whether the students experienced a gain in knowledge and
   professional conversational skills, whether videos or feedback helped
   them improve more and general questions about the structure and content
   of the curriculum. Differences between feedback groups were analysed
   (Mann-Whitney U test).
   Results 45 participants (peer group: n = 23, expert group: n = 22) took
   part in the study. The peer group experienced watching their video
   (38\%) and receiving feedback (33\%) as their major beneficial aspect to
   improve communication skills (watching fellow student ` s video: 17\%,
   providing feedback: 12\%). The expert group experienced the major effect
   in receiving expert feedback (73\%, video watching: 27\%). The students
   said that communication skills should be a core competency in dental
   education learning outcomes (PG: 4.48 +/- 0.67, EG: 4.41 +/- 0.67; P >
   0.05) and that communication curricula should include video-based
   feedback (PG: 3.91 +/- 0.73, EG: 4.00 +/- 0.93; P > 0.05).
   Conclusion Watching videos and both receiving and providing peer group
   feedback were experienced as helpful in improving students'
   communication skills. These findings suggest that a longitudinal
   communication curriculum, which includes both video-based peer feedback
   and correlated self-reflection, is a promising learning approach for
   dental education.},

   contrastive for action representation understanding},
Journal = {NEURAL NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {179},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Self-supervised contrastive learning draws on power representational
   models to acquire generic semantic features from unlabeled data, and the
   key to training such models lies in how accurately to track motion
   features. Previous video contrastive learning methods have extensively
   used spatially or temporally augmentation as similar instances,
   resulting in models that are more likely to learn static backgrounds
   than motion features. To alleviate the background shortcuts, in this
   paper, we propose a c ross-view v iew m otion c onsistent (CVMC)
   self-supervised video inter-intra contrastive model to focus on the
   learning of local details and long-term temporal relationships.
   Specifically, we first extract the dynamic features of consecutive video
   snippets and then align these features based on multi-view motion
   consistency. Meanwhile, we compare the optimized dynamic features for
   instance comparison of different videos and local spatial fine-grained
   with temporal order in the same video, respectively. Ultimately, the
   joint optimization of spatio-temporal alignment and motion
   discrimination effectively fills the challenges of the missing
   components of instance recognition, spatial compactness, and temporal
   perception in self-supervised learning. Experimental results show that
   our proposed self-supervised model can effectively learn visual
   representation information and achieve highly competitive performance
   compared to other state-of-the-art methods in both action recognition
   and video retrieval tasks.},

Abstract = {Purpose One of the aims of medical education is to generate lifelong
   learners, leading to the identification of self-directed learning (SDL)
   as an essential component of medical education. While SDL is focused on
   an individual learner, collaboration is critically important in
   medicine. We developed an online course using the collaborative SDL
   (CSDL) framework. A goal for the course was for students to gain a
   better appreciation for the SDL process by exploring the COVID-19
   pandemic. Methods We utilized CSDL to implement a 2-week elective
   attended by fifteen M3 and M4 medical students. Students submitted short
   videos reflecting on their course experience and the relevance of the
   material to their future training. Qualitative analysis of reflections
   was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the CSDL framework, and
   an assessment of the course evaluations was performed to explore student
   perceptions of the course and its effectiveness at preparing them for
   practice. A survey regarding student perceptions of SDL was offered to
   M3 and M4 students in order to explore their experiences with SDL and
   perceptions of its importance in the context of the school curriculum.
   Results The CSDL framework was effective in making students aware of the
   importance of SDL in medical practice. Students gained basic and
   clinical knowledge about the subject, experienced increased confidence,
   and appreciated collaborating with their peers. The survey offered to
   the general student body reflected that all students perceived that they
   employed SDL in their time as medical students. However, many students
   indicated that they had not utilized components of SDL beyond
   synthesizing and assessing their learning needs. Conclusion CSDL is an
   effective method for promoting self-directed learning. Undergraduate
   medical course constructs utilizing CSDL will benefit students as they
   continue their career development.},

Title = {A predictive study of learner satisfaction and outcomes in face-to-face,

Volume = {13},

Abstract = {This study was conducted to assess the predictive relationships among
   delivery mode (DM), self-perceived learner-to-teacher interaction,
   self-rated computer skill, prior distance learning experience, and
   learners' satisfaction and outcomes. Participants were enrolled in
   courses which used three different DMs: face-to-face, satellite
   broadcasting, and live video-streaming (LVS). In each case, the course
   was offered simultaneously by the same teacher via all three formats.
   The results indicated no predictive utility of delivery mode for
   self-perceived learner-to-teacher interaction. On the other hand, the
   results supported the validity of self-perceived learner-to-teacher
   interaction as a predictor for student satisfaction and learning
   outcomes (measured by course final grades). To a lesser extent,
   self-rated computer skills and the number of distance learning courses
   taken played a weak role in learning outcomes and students'
   satisfaction. Overall, findings from the study support prior research
   that has reported the importance of learner-to-teacher interaction in
   learning outcomes and satisfaction of distance education students.

Title = {How does drawing influence the effectiveness of oral self-explanation
   versus instructional explanation in video learning?},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {55},
Number = {3},
Pages = {1189-1208},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of two types of oral explanations
   (ie, self-explanation vs. instructional explanation) and drawing
   activity (no drawing vs. drawing) on video learning outcomes. These
   outcomes were measured by visual attention to the video (indexed by
   fixation time on text and diagram areas), explanation quality (indexed
   by personal references, concepts, and elaborations), drawing quality,
   behaviour patterns and overall learning performance gain. A total of 116
   undergraduate and graduate students watched a 4-min video on the human
   body's respiratory system. They were randomly assigned to one of four
   conditions (explanation generation: self-explanation vs. instructional
   explanation x drawing activity: no drawing vs. drawing). Results
   indicated that without a drawing requirement, students in the
   self-explanation condition displayed fewer personal references and
   exhibited a lower learning performance gain than those in the
   instructional explanation condition. Conversely, when drawing was
   required, self-explanation students demonstrated higher drawing quality
   and better learning performance gain. Additionally, students in the
   drawing condition directed more attention to the diagram area than those
   in the no drawing condition. These findings suggest that in video
   learning (1) educators should encourage students to produce oral
   instructional explanations and (2) if the goal is for students to
   generate self-explanations, they should also be prompted to draw to
   bolster their self-explanation efforts.},

Abstract = {Objectives: We aimed at identifying and analyzing the accuracy of
   YouTube videos on colostomy and ileostomy. Methods: YouTube website was
   searched independently by researchers for videos on colostomy and
   ileostomy posted before the 18th of May, 2019. Based on predetermined
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, the videos matching the research
   objective were identified. Data related to each video were collected,
   and the videos were categorized using standardized criteria. Results: A
   total of 357 videos were identified. Finally, 149 videos were included
   in the study. Of these, 52 (35\%) were educationally useful, and 97
   (65\%) were not useful. None of the video parameters, including the
   number of viewers, duration, number of likes or dislikes, days on
   YouTube or number of comments, was able to differentiate between useful
   or not useful videos. The score of videos was 14.7 +/- 0.6 for valuable
   videos and 11.0 +/- 2.0 for not useful videos (p < 0.001). Conclusions:
   While there were a reasonably number of colostomy and ileostomy videos,
   there was a smaller number on the surgical procedure. Most
   non-educational videos were not consistent with clinical guidelines.
   Practical implications: YouTube videos on colostomy/ileostomy care can
   be an important educational re-source to patients. However, a
   collaboration between patients, nurse educators and
   universities/hospitals is needed to produce high-quality videos. (c)

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning involves students taking the responsibility of
   their own learning. Self-regulated learning students usually adopt a
   variety of learning strategies and behaviors, such as the performance
   offorethought-performance-reflection cycles or the regular and sequenced
   work over time, that eventually enable them to achieve a more
   significant and long-lasting learning. In this paper, we explore if
   these particular behaviors and strategies can be analyzed through the
   application of process mining techniques taking as data the events
   registered during the performance of learning activities. The discovery
   of the underlying processes followed by students can open new approaches
   to study the real self regulated strategies used by students. The paper
   reviews the techniques and tools available to perform the process mining
   of events related to self-regulated learning and describes some initial
   works in this area. Furthermore, as an initial empirical study, we
   analyze the process followed by students regarding the visualization of
   videos provided in a first-year engineering subject. The obtained
   results are studied taking into account the grades obtained by the
   students. The results show that the students that obtained the best
   grades follow more varied routes than the students that obtained the
   worst grades. In addition, the best ones are more regular over time
   regarding weekly video visualization, mainly at the beginning of the
   term, while the worst ones visualize the videos mainly at the second
   part of the term.},

Abstract = {This article provides an analysis of the integration of assessment for
   learning principles in the newly revised five-year Master of Education
   programme at the University of Oslo, Norway, across didactic subjects,
   pedagogy and school practice. The analysis draws on lecture notes,
   student videos and student exam papers among 143 student teachers,
   aiming to identify (a) the operationalisation of the assessment
   curriculum at the university campus, and in school practice, (b) how the
   student teachers use assessment principles as tools in their
   instructional designs and (c) how they self-assess their teaching
   practice. Our main finding is that student teachers seem to be more
   concerned with assessing their students than using self-assessment to
   improve their instruction. Based on the findings, we argue the
   importance of relating the teaching and learning activities with the
   assessment situations used in the teacher education programme.},

Abstract = {Citizens' immersion in interactive media, especially that of young
   people, suggests the need to review and adapt the teaching methodologies
   used in universities, bringing them closer to informal learning
   environments. This work focuses on assessing teaching pills as a
   resource in the university setting by means of case analysis. Firstly,
   by means of a questionnaire, the utility and difficulty expressed by
   students faced with teaching by audiovisual pills is evaluated, as is
   the relation between these two variables. Audience reception of the
   videos is then analysed using the YouTube Analytics tool. The results
   demonstrate a favourable opinion of utility, a medium-high level of
   difficulty and the lack of any relation between the two variables.
   Furthermore, the results show a common viewing pattern characterised by
   a drop in audience during the first second, sustained attention
   maintained for the following minutes, with peaks in viewing figures
   attributable to the repetition of specific fragments, and a loss of
   audience in the final moments. Despite the limitations inherent to the
   sample type, we conclude that a time limit on teaching videos is not
   determinant for their viewing, interest in the content having greater
   relevance.},

Title = {Self-Supervised Visual Learning by Variable Playback Speeds Prediction
   of a Video},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Pages = {79562-79571},
Abstract = {We propose a self-supervised visual learning method by predicting the
   variable playback speeds of a video. Without semantic labels, we learn
   the spatio-temporal visual representation of the video by leveraging the
   variations in the visual appearance according to different playback
   speeds under the assumption of temporal coherence. To learn the
   spatio-temporal visual variations in the entire video, we have not only
   predicted a single playback speed but also generated clips of various
   playback speeds and directions with randomized starting points. Hence
   the visual representation can be successfully learned from the meta
   information (playback speeds and directions) of the video. We also
   propose a new layer-dependable temporal group normalization method that
   can be applied to 3D convolutional networks to improve the
   representation learning performance where we divide the temporal
   features into several groups and normalize each one using the different
   corresponding parameters. We validate the effectiveness of our method by
   fine-tuning it to the action recognition and video retrieval tasks on
   UCF-101 and HMDB-51. All the source code is released in

Abstract = {This paper investigates the students' self-regulated learning in primary
   education when traditional teaching method, which is teacher-centered in
   a classroom, is replaced with online educational resources. Various
   online educational resources such as videos, simulations and learning
   games are readily available on the Web. In addition, mobile and
   classroom technologies, such as portable devices can be considered as
   teaching tools in education. The good use of these educational resources
   and technologies cannot only assist students' formal classroom learning,
   but also cultivate the self-regulated learning of students. The
   i-Classroom implemented in a primary school adopted a new teaching
   method, which made use of the online educational resources and
   information technology, to achieve this goal. A survey (Sample size N =
   149) was conducted to investigate the effectiveness of promoting
   self-regulated learning in three key aspects: learning motivation,
   planning and management, and self-monitoring. The result shows the
   current situation of the self-regulated learning of primary school
   students and discusses how i-Classroom can help students to enhance
   their ability to conduct self-regulated learning.},

Title = {Video reflection: An emerging tool for training client-centred
   communication skills in staff supporting adults with learning
   disabilities in an education setting},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF LEARNING DISABILITIES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {48},
Number = {2},
Pages = {132-141},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Accessible summary
   Video reflection is one of the best ways to help staff develop their
   communication skills provided the training setting is supportive. Good
   communication skills are important so staff can support people with
   learning disabilities access education. This study filmed education
   staff working with people with a learning disability at college. The
   staff watched the video so they could see themselves and think about
   what they did well and what they could improve on. The results found
   that staff were better at communicating and more confident using their
   communication skills after watching the video. Background Speech and
   language therapists (SLTs) contribute to communication with adults with
   learning disabilities by providing training to the networks that support
   them. The requirements for successful communication with this population
   are frequently complex and necessitate an effective training medium to
   transfer the target knowledge and skills. Video has increasingly been
   used as a tool to facilitate self-reflection and behaviour change.
   Currently, there is limited research into the effectiveness of
   video-based training in education settings for adults with learning
   disabilities. Therefore, this study investigated the effectiveness of
   video reflection training (VRT) for support staff in a college for
   adults with learning disabilities. Materials and Method Ten staff
   members with diverse skill sets completed three VRT sessions aimed at
   improving their use of communication strategies. Training evaluation
   measures were taken before and after VRT and included use of
   communication strategies, self-efficacy, training pre-conceptions and
   training experience. Results Overall, the majority of staff made gains
   either in their use of communication strategies or in their
   self-efficacy ratings. Yet, study limitations restrict conclusions
   regarding whether VRT itself caused these outcomes. Interpretation
   revealed five factors relating to the effectiveness of VRT: tailoring
   training to staff's pre-existing skills, practising facilitation
   techniques, providing acceptable training, increasing self-reflection
   skills and using video as a reflection tool. Conclusions Regardless of
   the limitations, this study provides findings that VRT is a useful tool
   for training support staff to use client-centred communication skills in
   an education setting. Future training programmes should be
   individualised and tailored to staff depending on their skill sets.},

Abstract = {Engagement plays an essential role in the learning process. Recognition
   of learning engagement in the classroom helps us understand the
   student's learning state and optimize the teaching and study processes.
   Traditional recognition methods such as self-report and teacher
   observation are time-consuming and obtrusive to satisfy the needs of
   large-scale classrooms. With the development of big data analysis and
   artificial intelligence, applying intelligent methods such as deep
   learning to recognize learning engagement has become the research
   hotspot in education. In this paper, based on non-invasive classroom
   videos, first, a multi-cues classroom learning engagement database was
   constructed. Then, we introduced the power IoU loss function to You Only
   Look Once version 5 (YOLOv5) to detect the students and obtained a
   precision of 95.4\%. Finally, we designed a bimodal learning engagement
   recognition method based on ResNet50 and CoAtNet. Our proposed bimodal
   learning engagement method obtained an accuracy of 93.94\% using the KNN
   classifier. The experimental results confirmed that the proposed method
   outperforms most state-of-the-art techniques.},

Abstract = {Learning manipulation skills from observing human demonstration video is
   a promising aspect for intelligent robotic systems. Recent advances in
   Video-to-Command (V2C) provide an end-to-end approach to translate a
   video into robot plans. However, simultaneous V2C and action
   segmentation remain a major challenge for bimanual manipulations with
   fine-grained actions. Another concern is the generalization capability
   of end-to-end approaches in dealing with varied task parameters as well
   as environmental changes between the learned skills and the one-shot
   task demonstration for the robot to replay. In this article, we propose
   a two-stream network for robots to learn and segment manipulation
   subactions from human demonstration videos. Our framework with the
   self-attention mechanism can segment learned skills and generate action
   commands simultaneously. To arrive at refined plans in situations of
   underspecified or redundant human demonstrations, we utilize PDDL-based
   skill scripts to model the semantics of demonstrated activities and
   infer latent movements. Experimental results on the extended
   manipulation data set indicate that our approach generates more accurate
   commands than the state-of-the-art methods. Real-world experiment
   results on a Baxter robotic arm also demonstrated the feasibility of our
   method in reproducing fine-grained actions from video demonstrations.},

   concepts and device structures. The animated videos are segmented into
   video clips of duration of 5 minutes or so, according to the sub-topics
   covered. Apart from the MODe for self-learning, the fairly independent
   animated videos clips have been useful in formal teaching delivery of
   courses in semiconductor devices and other related EEE courses, either
   as flipped classroom or supplementary teaching materials. With the
   pandemic constraints to educational activities, these animated videos
   are versatile for learning and teaching and almost freely accessible by

   from other countries. Migrant workers from abroad or companies with
   manufacturing plants overseas have gradually used video manual as
   teaching materials for enterprise education and training, especially
   when COVID-19 becomes a global epidemic crisis. This study used in-depth
   interview research methods to investigate both workers and managers in
   the same manufacturing industry. The results found that when using
   digital cameras to record and edit, the production line equipment can
   achieve the following effects: (1) Promoting junior workers'
   self-efficacy; (2) Use of different language translations can provide
   simultaneous education and training for workers from multiple countries;
   (3) Putting digital teaching materials on cloud will make employees to
   use digital mobile vehicles to download and learn, that can save more
   time for employees.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is crucial to students' learning. SRL is
   characterized by students taking initiative, showing perseverance and
   adaptively regulating their learning. Teachers play an essential role in
   promoting and fostering this process. However, several studies have
   shown that in primary education explicit instruction of SRL strategies
   barely takes place. Given the relevance of SRL for learning and
   preparing students for the knowledge society of the 21st century, it is
   of crucial importance that teachers in primary education learn how they
   can improve their students' SRL. In the present study, we implemented a
   professional development program (iSELF) in which primary teachers were
   trained and coached in promoting and fostering their students' SRL. The
   extent to which iSELF contributed to teachers' explicit instruction of
   SRL strategies was evaluated in a quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test
   design using video-based classroom observations. Thirty teachers from
   fourteen different primary schools participated in this study and were
   assigned to either a control (twelve teachers) or an experimental group
   (eighteen teachers). Results indicate that in both conditions explicit
   SRL strategy instruction is rare. However, explicit instruction of SRL
   strategies is significantly higher in the experimental group on the
   post-test compared to the control group showing that teachers do benefit
   from learning about explicit SRL instruction.},

Abstract = {Enhancing teachers' professional vision (TPV), characterized by
   selective attention (SA) and knowledge based reasoning (KBR), may
   contribute to increasing the quality of teaching-learning processes
   through higher perceived sense of efficacy, leading to
   autonomy-supportive environment. For this reason, in the past decades
   researchers and practitioners have been developing different strategies
   to positively influence TPV. Among them, one that have grown popular in
   science and clinical research is video-based self- and peer-reflection,
   along with expert-supported reflective practices. The aim of this
   research was to test the effect of a video-based reflection program on
   TPV, teachers' self-efficacy (TSE), and students' perceived motivational
   climate (MC) in the area of Physical Education (PE). Two primary school
   PE teachers and their 155 pupils participated in a 6-month, 3-step
   video-analysis program comprised of the analysis and self-reflection on
   one video-recorded class per month followed by peer-reflection meetings
   and Teacher Club discussions with experts in the field of PE and
   educational psychology. Pre- and post-test measures were taken using a
   categorical system for content codification, the Teachers' Sense of
   Efficacy Scale (TSES), and the Motivational Climate in Physical
   Education Scale (MCPES). At post-test, notable changes were found in
   both SA and KBR, in all domains of TSE, but not in students' perception
   of MC. However, a follow-up measurement session carried out six months
   after the end of the intervention showed significant changes in MC, at
   the same time as TSE scores remained on similar values as at post-test.
   Our findings suggest that video-based analysis could represent an
   essential part of any training program aiming to increasing teachers'
   responsiveness to diverse in-class situations. While an increased PV
   seems to have an immediate positive impact on TSE, our outcomes
   underline that those changes may take a longer time to transfer into
   more efficient teaching-learning practices modulating the in-class
   environment.},

Abstract = {In this study, we present the characteristic analysis of computational
   thinking (CT)-gifted elementary students in the fifth and sixth grade
   who participated in the gifted e-learning education. The students were
   able to upload their reports and questions on our smart learning system
   through a PC or smartphone and utilize the video chat facility so that
   video learning could be possible in real-time. Further, they were taught
   the CT learning phase of every 6 weeks in order to solve real-life
   problems and go through the discussing mission. The students were
   observed as having steadily improved their performance in the curriculum
   of a year (hereinafter referred to as an improvement group), and we want
   to focus on them to examine their characteristics.
   After the analysis, the correlation coefficient of the improvement group
   student is high, especially in tutoring education. They have been rated
   as excellent in interpersonal relationship ability with their mentor,
   who uploaded a lot of comments. They showed high motives of challenges,
   problem-solving skills and self-leading force. Also, the more the
   activities of these comments increases, the higher it is found that
   their self-esteem was developed.
   In addition, at the time of Scratch learning for CT ability, the result
   showed that immersive ability, creative problem-solving skills and
   interpersonal relationshipswere improved. In particular, compared to
   other students, they used the Remix features many times for
   collaboration with other students. Therefore, interpersonal relationship
   ability also improved.},

Abstract = {Video lectures are being widely used in online and blended learning
   classes worldwide, and their learning effectiveness is becoming a focus
   of many educators and researchers. This study examined the cognitive
   load and learning effectiveness of video lectures in terms of the type
   of knowledge being taught (declarative or procedural) and instructor
   visibility. Video lectures with and without an instructor were used to
   teach each type of knowledge. Sixty Chinese undergraduates were randomly
   assigned to two of the four lectures. They completed a cognitive load
   questionnaire and learning tests after viewing the lectures. The results
   of t-tests revealed that adding the instructor in a video lecture
   increased learners' cognitive load only when learning procedural
   knowledge; adding the instructor only facilitated declarative knowledge
   learning. The results suggest that the learning effectiveness of video
   lectures varies depending on the type of knowledge being taught and the
   presence or absence of an instructor.},

Abstract = {BackgroundSince the early 20th century, the development and widespread
   adoption of information technologies have created new opportunities in
   various aspects of human life, including education. This situation has
   provided educators with numerous opportunities to develop innovative
   learning methodologies and environments. Nowadays, interactive videos,
   commonly used in educational settings, provide students with a
   self-regulated learning environment where they can access learning
   materials on-demand.PurposeIn this research, our aim was to investigate
   the impact of interactive videos enriched with pop-up questions on the
   academic achievements of prospective science teachers.SampleA total of
   330 science teacher candidates participated in the study. Study I,
   conducted to assess teacher candidates' perceptions, involved 302
   participants. Study II, which measured the direct effects of the tests,
   included 330 participants.Design and MethodsThe study employed a
   mixed-method design with a quasi-experimental approach to compare
   learning outcomes.ResultsThe analysis revealed that the majority of
   participants expressed that interactive videos significantly contributed
   to their overall learning. While interactive videos did not have a
   direct impact on test performance, they were found to have an indirect
   effect.ConclusionBased on these findings, we concluded that interactive
   videos with pop-up questions positively influenced learning and are
   worthy of further exploration in future studies.},

Abstract = {Background: Self-instructional-video is an effective self-directed
   learning method of clinical procedural skills.
   Method: A single-blinded randomized controlled study comparing
   small-group-learning and individual learning was conducted to evaluate
   knowledge and skills retention of manual defibrillation and endotracheal
   intubation. Data were collected on knowledge, skill acquisition, and
   confidence, at pretest, post-test and retention at 6 months
   postintervention.
   Results: Small-group-learning demonstrated better outcomes on knowledge
   and skill acquisition of intubation compared to individual-learning. For
   defibrillation, both groups showed similar improvements in knowledge and
   skill acquisition.
   Conclusion: Self-directed small-group-learning is a better method for
   knowledge and skill acquisition, regardless of the procedure complexity

   EMBASE (1975-2012), and CINAHL (1983-2012) for controlled clinical
   trials that examined the effectiveness of video interventions in
   changing health behaviors. Twenty-eight studies comprised of 12,703
   subjects were included in the systematic review. Video interventions
   were variably effective for modifying health behaviors depending on the
   target behaviors to be influenced. Video interventions appear to be
   effective in breast self-examination, prostate cancer screening,
   sunscreen adherence, self-care in patients with heart failure, HIV
   testing, treatment adherence, and female condom use. However, videos
   have not shown to be effective in influencing addiction behaviors when
   they are not tailored. Compared to loss-framing, gain-framed messages
   may be more effective in promoting certain types of health behavior
   change. Also, video modeling may facilitate learning of new behaviors

Abstract = {The use of YouTube videos in learning English language has produced
   disruptive or alternative innovations for students learning anywhere in
   the world. YouTube English language learning videos have been dominated
   by content -driven and outcomes-driven curriculum approaches at the
   expense of a self -driven approach. The purpose of this study was to
   explore the YouTube video approaches used by students in the learning of
   English language in higher education in selected African countries. The
   study also sought to establish why students use YouTube approaches in
   learning English language in particular ways. Undergirded by the
   pragmatic paradigm and the mixed method approach, the study employed the
   use of the natural identity framework (NIF). A participatory action
   research with one -on -one semi-structured interviews, focus group
   discussions, document reviews and YouTube reviews/observations were
   applied in collecting data from 20 purposively and snowball sampled
   participants (English language students) to be thematically analysed for
   this study. The findings indicate that the dominance of these two
   approaches has produced tension between them that needs to be addressed
   by a selfdriven approach which is capable of creating a space for
   self-reflection before learning processes take place. It is for this
   tension that this study explores YouTube video approaches used in the
   learning of English language in higher education in Africa post the
   COVID-19 pandemic. A selfdriven approach concentrates on actions,
   beliefs behind the actions, and their outcomes of using YouTube videos.
   This study therefore recommends the application of a self -driven
   approach and awareness of natural forces/laws that promote natural
   actions, thus addressing personal, and natural needs.},

Abstract = {In response to the evolving landscape of electrical engineering
   education, this paper explores the integration of the flipped classroom
   model complemented by student-produced videos for assignment-solving.
   Videos, positioned as instructional tools within the flipped classroom,
   offer self-paced learning, improved accessibility, heightened
   engagement, and enhanced comprehension-addressing persistent challenges
   faced by electrical engineering students. The primary focus is on
   courses tailored for electrical engineering students, fostering
   peer-to-peer interactive learning, knowledge exchange, and a nuanced
   understanding of course material. The proposal to establish YouTube
   channels for hosting these videos presents a sustainable platform for
   collaborative learning that evolves and improves over time. The efficacy
   of this approach, evident in improved learning outcomes, underscores the
   transformative potential of video tutorials and tangible user
   interfaces. The conclusion reflects on the practical implications of
   this pedagogical approach, offering insights for educators,
   institutions, and students seeking innovative methods to enhance the
   educational experience. Acknowledging potential limitations, the study
   invites future research to build upon these findings, contributing to
   the ongoing discourse on innovative teaching methods in electrical
   engineering education. In essence, our research illuminates the
   transformative impact of integrating student-produced videos within the
   flipped classroom model, offering a unique perspective on collaborative
   learning and technological integration for improved educational
   outcomes..},

Abstract = {Special education teacher development is continually studied to
   determine best practices for improving teacher quality and promoting
   student learning. Video analysis is commonly included in teacher
   development targeting both teacher thinking and practice intended to
   improve learning opportunities for students. Positive research findings
   support video analysis as a teacher development tool, but the practice
   has not been deemed evidence based. In this evaluation, quality
   indicators, adapted from special education research and government
   recommendations, were used to determine whether video analysis is an
   evidence-based practice for developing special education pre-service and
   in-service teachers. A systematic literature search resulted in 113
   identified articles which were narrowed to seven experimental studies
   using screening criteria adapted from What Works Clearing House.
   Significant findings supported video analysis across all seven studies,
   and the overall quality of the published research suggests video
   analysis is a promising practice. Implications and recommendations for
   special education teacher development are discussed.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: A video coaching (VC) system has been developed in surgical
   education. This study compares the educational effect on technical and
   nontechnical skills of the VC method for teaching laparoscopic surgery.
   DESIGN: We conducted a prospectively randomized study of an education
   program to teach laparoscopic procedures.
   SETTING: The study was performed at the Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, a
   university hospital in Taiwan.
   PARTICIPANTS: We enrolled sixteen first- or second-year surgical
   residents.The participants were randomized into VC and conventional
   teaching (CT) groups, and their surgical skills were judged by the
   Global Operation Assessment of Laparoscopic Skills (GOALS) and the
   Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS).
   Nontechnical skills were evaluated by the Non-Technical Skills for
   Surgeons (NOTSS) assessment and self-efficacy questionnaires (SEQs).
   After the program, posttraining scores were compared to assess
   improvements.
   RESULTS: The 16 enrolled participants finished the entire course and
   completed all the videos during the study period. Comparing the VC and
   CT groups, we found that the pretraining GOALS, OSATS, NOTSS and SEQ
   scores were similar between both groups. However, after training, the
   OSATS score gain was higher in the VC groupthan in the CT group (9.25
   +/- 2.05 vs. 6.50 +/- 1.51, p=0.009). Regarding nontechnical skills, the
   NOTSS score improved more in the VC group than in the CT group (5.50 +/-
   0.93 vs. 4.25 +/- 0.89, p=0.015). The SEQ score was also higher in the
   VC group (32.13 +/- 2.10) than in the CT group (29.50 +/- 1.77), with a
   significant difference (p=0.018).
   CONCLUSION: VC can help surgeons build their expertise using a more
   accessible method. Additionally, VC can shorten the learning curve and
   improve self-efficacy, thereby contributing to surgeons' education. (C)

Title = {A Comparison of Guided Video Reflection versus Self-Regulated Learning
   to Teach Knot Tying to Medical Students: A Pilot Randomized Controlled
   Trial},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {77},

Month = {JUL-AUG},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Self-regulated learning has been proposed as a resource
   saving alternative for learning knot tying. However, this may be
   hindered by the Dunning-Kruger effect. A potential alternative is guided
   video reflection. The objectives of this study are to compare the
   performance and self-assessment abilities amongst medical students
   learning knot tying using either a traditional selfregulated approach
   versus guided video reflection.
   DESIGN: This randomized, single-blinded, controlled trial used a
   pre-post-retention test design. All knot tying performances were video
   recorded and assessed nonsequentially by blinded evaluators using a
   modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills tool.
   PARTICIPANTS: This study recruited 31 first- and second-year medical
   students and 6 senior urology residents from Western University in
   Canada.
   RESULTS: At baseline, the performances of the experts were significantly
   higher than the experimental groups (F3,85 = 9.080, p < 0.001). After
   the intervention, there was a significant increase in the performance
   for both experimental groups compared to the pretest period (p < 0.001).
   The scores between the experimental groups were not significantly
   different (p = 0.338). The improved performances of both groups were
   sustained on retention testing (p < 0.001). The self-assessment
   abilities were accurate for both experimental groups at baseline.
   However, at the post-test period the accuracy was poor (interclass
   correlation 0.361) for the self-regulated group, while remaining
   moderately (interclass correlation 0.685) accurate for the reflection
   group.
   CONCLUSIONS: Students using guided video reflection were able to achieve
   competency and maintained their knot tying skills to the same degree as
   those who used the self-regulated approach. These results may be due to
   the positive effects of reflection on self-assessment abilities and
   subsequent improvement in goal setting for further practice. (C) 2020

Title = {Controlling the display of videos in a physical education context:
   effects on learning outcomes and situational interest},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {5},
Pages = {517-529},
Month = {SEP 3},
Abstract = {Background Instructional videos are increasingly employed in a physical
   education domain in order to enhance motor learning and
   self-motivational beliefs. However, evidence showed that videos are
   generally ineffective because they often create extraneous loads due to
   the information transience and passive processing of information.
   Purpose The current study investigates the effects of controlling the
   display of video on learning outcomes - expressed in terms of recall and
   transfer scores - and situational interest in physical education
   settings. Method 60 tenth-grade students (M-age = 15.90 years, SDage =
   1.32 months; 30 boys and 30 girls) were instructed to study using either
   a continuous video (presented without pauses), a system-controlled video
   using predefined segments or a self-controlled video where the learner
   uses `stop' and `play' keys. Then, they were asked to perform the
   learning tests (i.e. game comprehension test and game performance test)
   and evaluate the situational interest of the learning materials (i.e.
   attention demand, challenge, exploration intention, instant enjoyment,
   novelty). Findings The results from one-way ANOVAs revealed that
   students performed significantly better on both recall and transfer
   post-tests when the video was either system-controlled or
   self-controlled, which suggested that studying a controlled video could
   decrease irrelevant cognitive load and so yield better learning
   performances. Concerning the situational interest variable, students in
   the self-controlled condition scored significantly higher on almost all
   dimensions of situational interest. Conclusion This study indicates that
   self-controlled video, as applied in this study, can be integrated in a
   physical education context to foster learning and enhance situational
   interest. The discussion advances several options for enhancing the
   effectiveness of instructional videos during physical education lessons.},

   results. Secondary measures were collected on observational learning
   across participants and behaviors. Participants included 4 children with
   autism, ages 8-11, who were served in self-contained special education
   classrooms. Results indicated a functional relation between video
   modeling and increased independence in gaming; observational learning
   occurred for at least some steps across students. Results, implications
   for practitioners, limitations, and ideas for future research are

Abstract = {The main objective of this work is to make a proposal for continuous
   improvement on the use of short educational videos in order to improve
   the teaching-learning process at Mathematics I, a university subject
   present in the curriculum of several social-economical degrees such as
   Business Administration, Economics, or International Business at the
   Universitat de Valencia (Spain). In order to enhance the quality of this
   process, it is necessary to make inquiries of the impressions that the
   students have about it. In this particular case, we wanted to know the
   perception that students had after the use of short educational videos
   of applied mathematics contents during the course. These videos were
   carefully created by their professors in order to promote autonomous and
   active learning. Thus, we developed an opinion survey to gather their
   opinions. This survey measured the students' perception on the degree of
   usefulness of the teaching materials of the subject and, in particular,
   the degree of satisfaction on the short educational videos. The results
   show that, in general, there is a high degree of satisfaction in the use
   of these videos for self-learning of mathematical concepts. Suggestions
   from the students allowed us to adopt improvement measures devoted to
   upgrade the quality of the teaching-learning process.},

Title = {Ultrasound versus videos: A comparative study on the effectiveness of
   musculoskeletal anatomy education and student cognition},
Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},

Pages = {1089-1101},

Abstract = {Ultrasound imaging is a dynamic imaging technique that uses
   high-frequency sound waves to capture live images of the structures
   beneath the skin. In addition to its growing use in diagnosis and
   interventions, ultrasound imaging has the potential to reinforce
   concepts in the undergraduate medical curriculum. However, research
   assessing the impact of ultrasound on anatomy learning and student
   cognition is scarce. The purpose of this study was to compare the impact
   of ultrasound-based instruction versus narrated videos on students'
   understanding of anatomical relationships, as well as the role of
   intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy beliefs, and students' attitudes in
   this process. A booster course on anterior leg and wrist anatomy was
   offered to second-year medical students. A randomized controlled trial
   with a cross-over design allocated students to either an
   ultrasound-based teaching condition (cohort A) or a narrated anatomy
   video condition (cohort B). Next, participants were crossed to the
   alternative intervention. At the start of the study (T0), baseline
   anatomy knowledge, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy beliefs, and
   spatial ability were measured. After the first intervention (T1) and at
   the end of the study (T2), both cohorts were administered an anatomy
   test, an intrinsic motivation scale, and a self-efficacy scale. In
   addition, each student was asked to fill out a perception survey after
   the ultrasound intervention. Finally, building on the cross-over design,
   the most optimal sequence of interventions was examined. A total of 181
   students participated (cohort A: n = 82, cohort B: n = 99). Both cohorts
   performed comparably on the baseline anatomy knowledge test, spatial
   ability test, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy scale. At T1,
   cohort B outperformed cohort A on the anatomy test (p = 0.019), although
   only a small effect size could be detected (Cohen's d = 0.34). Intrinsic
   motivation and self-efficacy of both cohorts were similar at T1. At T2,
   the anatomy test, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy scale did not
   reflect an effect after studying either sequence of the interventions.
   Students reported favorably about the ultrasound experience, but also
   mentioned a steep learning curve. Medical students found the hands-on
   ultrasound sessions to be valuable, increasing their interest in
   musculoskeletal anatomy and ultrasound imaging. However, the addition of
   ultrasound did not result in superior spatial anatomy understanding
   compared to watching anatomy videos. In addition, ultrasound teaching
   did not have a major effect on student cognition. Ultrasound-based
   teaching of musculoskeletal anatomy is regarded as difficult to learn,
   and therefore it is hypothesized that too high levels of cognitive load
   might explain the presented results.},

Abstract = {Video-based and 360-Degree Video-based learning is still not spread in
   the social studies classroom. The present research intends to study the
   influence of these tools on seventh grade students' level of knowledge
   in social studies. One hundred and five seventh grade students
   participated in the present research. Thirty-five students constituted
   each one of three classes: a regular class, a video-based class and a
   360-Degree video-based class. Each class was assigned arbitrarily a
   specific teaching method: the regular method, the video method and the
   360-Degree video-based method. The research results indicated that the
   regular group had significantly higher scores in the Applying knowledge
   level than the 360-Degree video-based group. It also indicated that the
   video group had significantly higher scores in the Analysis knowledge
   level than the control and the 360-Degree video groups. Moreover, the
   results indicated that the video and the 360-Degree video groups had
   significantly higher scores in the Synthesis knowledge level than the
   control group. The two technological tools did not contribute to the
   Evaluating level. More research is needed to verify the impact of
   video-based learning and 360-Degree video-based learning on students'
   knowledge levels; especially on higher-order thinking processes, in the
   different disciplines, but particularly in the social studies.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we propose a new online authoring tool for e-Learning
   system to meet the social demands for internationalized higher
   education. The tool includes two functions an authoring function for
   creating video-based content by the instructor, and a viewing function
   for self-learning by students. In the authoring function, an instructor
   creates key markings onto the raw video stream to produce virtual video
   clips related to each slide. With key markings, some parts of the raw
   video stream can be easily skipped. The virtual video clips form an
   aggregated video stream that is used to synchronize with the slide
   presentation to create learning content. The synchronized content can be
   previewed immediately at the client computer prior to saving at the
   server. The aggregated video becomes the baseline for the viewing
   function. Based on aggregated video stream methodology, content editing
   requires only the changing of key markings without editing the raw video
   file. Furthermore, video and pointer synchronization is also proposed
   for enhancing the students' learning efficiency. In viewing function,
   video quality control and an adaptive video buffering method are
   implemented to support usage in various network environments. The total
   system is optimized to support cross-platform and cloud computing to
   break the limitation of various usages. The proposed method can provide
   simple authoring processes with clear user interface design for
   instructors, and help students utilize learning contents effectively and
   efficiently. In the user acceptance evaluation, most respondents agree
   with the usefulness, ease-of-use, and user satisfaction of the proposed
   system. The overall results show that the proposed authoring and viewing
   tools have higher user acceptance as a tool for e-Learning.},

Abstract = {We used a multi-component single-subject experimental design across
   three preschool teachers to examine the effects of video self-monitoring
   with graduated training and feedback on the accuracy with which teachers
   monitored their implementation of embedded instructional learning
   trials. We also examined changes in teachers' implementation of learning
   trials. In each self-monitoring condition, teachers observed and
   recorded their implemented learning trials using video and a coding
   form. Conditions differed in the specificity of prompts on the coding
   form and the type of training and feedback provided. The combination of
   training, coding forms with specific prompts for learning trial
   components, and external feedback generally resulted in more accurate
   self-monitoring for two of three participants and increases in the
   fidelity of implementation of learning trials. Findings suggest
   self-monitoring can be effective for increasing the fidelity with which
   teachers implement embedded instructional learning trials, but
   systematic training and feedback are important for ensuring
   self-monitoring accuracy.},

Abstract = {In the present study, we tested the effectiveness of three learning
   strategies (self-explanation, learning by teaching and passive viewing)
   used by students who were learning from video lectures. Effectiveness
   was measured not only with traditional measures, but also with
   electroencephalography (EEG). Using a within-subjects design, 26
   university students viewed three sets of short lectures, each presenting
   a different set of English vocabulary words and were asked to use a
   different learning strategy for each set of lectures. Participants' EEG
   signals were assessed while watching the videos; learning experience
   (self-reported motivation and engagement) and learning performance
   (vocabulary recall test score) were assessed after watching the videos.
   Repeated measures ANOVAs showed that the self-explaining and teaching
   strategies were more beneficial than the passive viewing strategy, as
   indicated by higher EEG theta and alpha band power, a more positive
   learning experience (higher motivation and engagement) and better
   learning performance. However, whereas the teaching strategy elicited
   greater neural oscillations related to working memory and attention
   compared to the self-explanation strategy, the two groups did not differ
   on self-reported learning experience or learning performance. Our
   findings are discussed in terms of potential application in courses
   using video lectures and in terms of their heuristic value for future
   research on the neural processes that differentiate learning strategies.},

Abstract = {Purpose In today's dynamic situation, innumerable challenges are posited
   in the education sector because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Higher
   educational institutes (HEIs) are compelled to adopt digital
   technologies and technology-mediated learning in the teaching-learning
   processes. The purpose of this paper is to understand the factors
   affecting learning effectiveness, learning satisfaction and the
   mediating role of prerecorded videos from the learners' perspective.
   Design/methodology/approach A self-designed structured questionnaire
   based on previous similar studies is adopted as a survey instrument. It
   consists of 22 questions to address the five constructs of the proposed
   hypothesized conceptual model, developed for the study. Data of 311
   students from HEIs of Maharashtra state in India were collected.
   Confirmatory factor analysis is carried out to test the model fitness,
   reliability and validity, and structural equation modeling is applied to
   conduct path analysis and hypotheses testing of the model. Findings
   Hypotheses testing reveals that perceived usefulness (PU) significantly
   affects the perceived learning effectiveness, which again affects the
   learning satisfaction of the students. In addition, perceived ease of
   use affects the PU as suggested in the technology acceptance model. The
   prerecorded videos have a moderating role to play in the computer
   self-efficacy and the perceived learning effectiveness of the students.
   This research will provide meaningful acumen to enhance the overall
   learning process among students in urban as well as rural India.
   Originality/value This study explores the technology-mediated learning
   during the unexpected and dynamic situations of the COVID-19 pandemic in
   the context of higher education in India. For sustainable use of
   technology-assisted learning, educators must understand the key factors
   that influence students' learning effectiveness and satisfaction. The
   research outcomes will lead toward developing the human capacities, as
   the prerecorded videos at the HEIs of India will provide new approaches
   for effectively adopting digital technologies and technology-mediated
   learning.},

   video narratives from a diverse spectrum of people discussing individual
   and regional beliefs about the role of and intersections between
   education and sustainability. These media and data are being shared
   online while the team is in the field. In addition, the general public
   has been contributing their own perspectives on these issues via
   self-posted videos within an online EnviroNetwork. The video narratives
   gathered to date illustrate both how education can influence
   sustainability in different regions of the world, and the complexities

Abstract = {Professional communication skills have a substantial effect on dental
   patient satisfaction and health outcomes and are one of the core
   competencies expected of newly graduated dentists in Australia.
   Acquisition of effective, goal-oriented communication skills has been
   shown to improve the dentist-patient relationship and requires both
   practicing skills and reflective thinking. The use of technologies such
   as video-recording to communicate directly and individually with
   students can be used to enhance students' engagement and communication
   skills. This paper aims to present the results of the implementation of
   the video recording of role-plays and self-reflection in the training of
   communication skills of first-year dental students at Griffith
   University, Australia. The year 2015 was used as a control, and in 2016
   we introduced video recording, and in 2017 self-reflection. The tools
   used to measure the impact of these teaching instruments were: (1)
   student evaluation of courses (SEC) data, and (2) results of the final
   practical exam grades in the Communication Skills for Oral Health
   Course. The skills assessed and reflected on include: verbal and
   non-verbal communication, metacommunication, self-confidence, rapport,
   active listening, and mindfulness. Recordings and facilitator's feedback
   can be accessed by each student for their self-reflection on their
   overall performance, communication skills, patient-centered approach and
   strategies on how to improve their skills. Results of the SEC data show
   enhancements in engagement (68-83\% +ve answers), assessment (66-78\%
   +ve answers) and feedback (81-89\% +ve answers). Results of their
   average final practical marks increased from 57.82\% (control) to
   63.34\% (with video), and finally 79.64\% (with video and
   self-reflection). These results strongly suggest that the inclusion of
   the digital recording of role play interactions and self-reflection
   increases the quality of communication skills training for dental
   students by enhancing their dentist-patient relationship skills,
   engagement, confidence, satisfaction with assessment and the quality of
   the feedback that can be provided.},

Title = {Learning about ovarian cancer at the time of diagnosis: Video versus

Volume = {119},

Abstract = {Objective. Effective patient -clinician communication at diagnosis is
   important, yet decreased provider time for face-to-face interactions
   makes traditional paradigms in cancer care difficult. We evaluated the
   effects of an educational video on patients' distress, cancer knowledge,
   coping skills and attitudes regarding learning about cancer at the time
   of ovarian cancer diagnosis.
   Methods. An educational video was developed in which oncology
   professionals, women with ovarian cancer, and their relatives discussed
   cancer information and experiences. Women admitted for initial
   diagnostic surgical staging for ovarian cancer were randomized to the
   educational or placebo video. Before and after the video, patients
   completed measures of (1) ovarian cancer information, (2) emotional
   distress, (3) learning attitudes, and (4) coping self-efficacy. Outcomes
   were analyzed for differences in mean change between intervention and
   placebo groups using t-tests.
   Results. Fifty-nine subjects were randomized (30 intervention/29
   placebo). The majority were advanced staged, white, insured, high school
   educated, employed, and rated their disease seriousness as high.
   Anxiety, general distress and cancer-specific distress were high.
   Pre-post video: distress and self-efficacy between groups were
   unchanged, intervention subjects answered more knowledge items correctly
   (p = 0.0004) and developed more negative learning attitudes (p = 0.037).
   Following the educational video, patients who developed more negative
   attitudes also had increased intrusive thinking (p = 0.046), a sign of
   increased distress.
   Conclusions. Video presentation of cancer-related information increases
   learning under conditions of high distress and disease threat however,
   it is not without risk for some. Differing information needs may affect
   women's emotional response under these conditions. (C) 2010 Elsevier

Abstract = {The use of tablets in a classroom is a usual practice at any educative
   level nowadays, from childhood education to university levels. The use
   of new technologies as an educational tool is a motivation for the
   students, and this motivation is greater if novelty devices, such as
   tablets, are considered. In the university, tablets are more usual in
   classroom due to different reasons, for instance because of the
   portability, the potential and the applicability. These mobile devices
   are replacing notebooks and netbooks in the e-learning/e-teaching
   process at classroom. For this reason, the performing of new didactic
   materials for these new devices is a necessity. New applications for
   tablets are being developed for helping to students in the e-learning
   process. On the other hand, these devices enable to introduce a new
   self-learning methodology.
   There is a great quantity of teaching material developed for a computer.
   Besides that this material can also be used by a tablet, it can be
   improved through specific applications by using the characteristics of a
   tablet; touchscreen, easy web browsing, etcetera. APPES (acronym of APPs
   of E-Statistics) is an application designed by professionals of
   statistics and experts in computing, from the University of Granada. The
   aim of this application is to develop e-teaching applications of
   statistics for a tablet, by introducing a new methodology. Theoretical
   and practical materials are introduced in a dynamic form with
   self-readable texts. Two of the main objectives of the developed
   methodology are, the virtual e-teaching and to favor the autonomous
   learning process. The tutorial videos built are one fundamental aspect
   in this sense. One interesting option of these tutorial videos is that
   they can be shown with subtitles. In this work, the main characteristics
   of APPES, its technical and educational aspects in general, and the use
   of tutorial videos in particular, are shown. This new methodology
   enables people with Special Educational Needs (SEN) to facilitate the
   learning and teaching of Statistics.},

Abstract = {During the COVID-19 pandemic, campuses are closed, and many schools are
   forced to transition to online instruction. There are many problems in
   landscape architecture education during the pandemic such as students'
   decreased attention, poor self-regulation, low proactivity, and
   difficulty in grading. In addition, situational effects are required for
   landscape architecture education, but online education lacks the
   necessary case scenarios for courses during the pandemic. In order to
   solve these problems, the present study adopted a more accessible, and
   interactive spherical video-based immersive virtual reality (SV-IVR)
   approach, developed a landscape architecture SV-IVR learning system, and
   conducted a quasi-experimental study to examine its effectiveness. The
   results indicated that the experimental group students showed more
   positive results in their learning achievements, learning attitudes, and
   self-regulation than the control group. Besides, it was found that
   students required more time to develop their self-efficacy and that this
   system would not have an effect on students' cognitive load.},

Abstract = {Due to the pandemic-induced mobility restrictions, time spent in front
   of a device, videoconferencing, and, in particular, e-learning increased
   significantly. Zoom and other video conferencing applications will
   continue to be part of our everyday life as organizations decide to
   continue to work remotely in the years to come. Multitasking has been
   long researched, however, due to the pandemic, it has prompted the need
   to investigate multitasking in contexts where the primary task is to
   attend an e-learning video conference session. In general, there has
   been limited research on the effects of multitasking in remote settings.
   Moreover, most studies on multitasking have involved the use of diaries
   or self-reported testimonies for data collection. To fill the
   abovementioned theoretical void and methodological limitation, we
   collect physiological data to better understand how task volume and
   visual attention in a multitasking setting affect learning performance
   during an e-learning video conference session. Results suggest that
   multitasking does not affect information retention but it does affect
   users' perceived information retention. The practical implications
   discussed are important for the education sector, as well as, and more
   broadly, for organizations using video conferencing to communicate and
   collaborate, as they help explain how multitasking behaviors may affect
   work productivity and performance.},

Title = {The effect of verbal feedback, video feedback, and self-assessment on
   laparoscopic intracorporeal suturing skills in novices: a randomized

Abstract = {Background Laparoscopic skill acquisition involves a steep learning
   curve and laparoscopic suturing is an exceptionally challenging task. By
   improving the way feedback is given, trainees can learn these skills
   more effectively. This study aims to establish the most effective form
   of structured feedback on laparoscopic suturing skill acquisition in
   novices, by comparing the effects of expert verbal feedback, video
   review with expert feedback (video feedback), and video review with
   self-assessment. Methods A prospective randomized blinded trial
   comparing verbal feedback, video feedback, and self-assessment. Novices
   in laparoscopic surgery were tasked with performing laparoscopic
   suturing with intracorporeal knot tying. Time was given for practice,
   and pre- and post-feedback assessments were undertaken. Suturing
   performance was measured using a task-specific checklist and global
   ratings. A post-study questionnaire was used to measure
   participant-perceived confidence, knowledge, and experience levels.
   Results Fifty-one participants were randomized and allocated equally
   into the three groups. Performance in all three groups improved
   significantly from baseline. Video feedback had the largest improvement
   margin with checklist and global score improvements of 17.1\% (+/-
   9.9\%) and 14.7\% (+/- 9.3\%), respectively. Performance improvements
   between groups were statistically significant in the global components
   (p = 0.004) but not the checklist components (p = 0.186). Global score
   improvement was significantly better in the video feedback group but was
   statistically insignificant between the self-assessment and verbal
   feedback groups. Questionnaire responses demonstrated positive results
   in confidence, knowledge, and experience levels, across all three study
   groups, with no differences between the groups (p > 0.05). Conclusion
   Structured video feedback facilitates reflection and self-directed
   learning, which improves the ability to develop proficiency in surgical
   skills. Combining both self-assessment and video feedback may be
   beneficial over verbal feedback alone due to the advantages of video
   review. These techniques should therefore be considered for
   implementation into surgical education curricula.},

Title = {SSMTL plus plus : Revisiting self-supervised multi-task learning for
   video anomaly detection},
Journal = {COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {229},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {A self-supervised multi-task learning (SSMTL) framework for video
   anomaly detection was recently introduced in literature. Due to its
   highly accurate results, the method attracted the attention of many
   researchers. In this work, we revisit the self-supervised multi-task
   learning framework, proposing several updates to the original method.
   First, we study various detection methods, e.g. based on detecting
   high-motion regions using optical flow or background subtraction, since
   we believe the currently used pre-trained YOLOv3 is suboptimal, e.g.
   objects in motion or objects from unknown classes are never detected.
   Second, we modernize the 3D convolutional backbone by introducing
   multi-head self-attention modules, inspired by the recent success of
   vision transformers. As such, we alternatively introduce both 2D and 3D
   convolutional vision transformer (CvT) blocks. Third, in our attempt to
   further improve the model, we study additional self-supervised learning
   tasks, such as predicting segmentation maps through knowledge
   distillation, solving jigsaw puzzles, estimating body pose through
   knowledge distillation, predicting masked regions (inpainting), and
   adversarial learning with pseudo-anomalies. We conduct experiments to
   assess the performance impact of the introduced changes. Upon finding
   more promising configurations of the framework, dubbed SSMTL++v1 and
   SSMTL++v2, we extend our preliminary experiments to more data sets,
   demonstrating that our performance gains are consistent across all data
   sets. In most cases, our results on Avenue, ShanghaiTech and UBnormal
   raise the state-of-the-art performance bar to a new level.},

Title = {The Development of an Educational Video on Blood Pressure Measurement
   for Pharmacy Students},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN MEDICAL EDUCATION AND PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {655-663},
Abstract = {Introduction: High blood pressure is an important worldwide health
   issue. Pharmacists can perform multifaceted tasks in hypertension
   management such as measuring blood pressure. In a time where the use of
   educational videos in health professions education has increased, an
   educational video might be an option for teaching blood pressure
   measurement skills to pharmacy students. This project aimed to develop
   an educational video tailored to pharmacy students on oscillometric
   blood pressure measurement in a community pharmacy setting that can be
   used as a self-instruction video.
   Methods: The video was created with support from the university's
   multimedia center. The video development was roughly divided into
   pre-production, production, and post-production. Students' satisfaction
   with and perception of the video was surveyed.
   Results: An 11-minute 33-second self-instruction video in the German
   language on proper oscillometric blood pressure measurement tailored for
   pharmacy students was created. Along with descriptive slides, the video
   delineates the necessary steps of blood pressure measurement in a
   community pharmacy setting in a role-play, to support students in
   communication with the patient. Results of a survey on the satisfaction
   and perception of the video from thirty-seven pharmacy students were
   included in the analysis and revealed that the video was well accepted
   by pharmacy students. Moreover, approximately 95\% responded that
   instructional videos should be included in future pharmacy education.
   Conclusion: We successfully developed an educational video on
   oscillometric blood pressure measurement for a community pharmacy
   setting. This work is a valuable form of support for faculty members,
   who intend to develop educational videos. This might be of interest
   especially during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic,
   where distance learning has become highly relevant.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {27},
Number = {7},
Pages = {3210-3221},

Abstract = {Existing video hash functions are built on three isolated stages: frame
   pooling, relaxed learning, and binarization, which have not adequately
   explored the temporal order of video frames in a joint binary
   optimization model, resulting in severe information loss. In this paper,
   we propose a novel unsupervised video hashing framework dubbed
   self-supervised video hashing (SSVH), which is able to capture the
   temporal nature of videos in an end-to-end learning to hash fashion. We
   specifically address two central problems: 1) how to design an
   encoder-decoder architecture to generate binary codes for videos and 2)
   how to equip the binary codes with the ability of accurate video
   retrieval. We design a hierarchical binary auto-encoder to model the
   temporal dependencies in videos with multiple granularities, and embed
   the videos into binary codes with less computations than the stacked
   architecture. Then, we encourage the binary codes to simultaneously
   reconstruct the visual content and neighborhood structure of the videos.
   Experiments on two real-world data sets show that our SSVH method can
   significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods and achieve the
   current best performance on the task of unsupervised video retrieval.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {124},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Online learning environments demand learners to self-regulate their
   learning but many learners are poor at selfregulated learning (SRL). In
   this paper, two studies were conducted to examine the effect of two SRL
   supports, i. e., guiding goal setting and planning using an approach
   known as mental contrasting and implementation intentions (MCII) and
   prompting SRL using videos, on motivation in the form of task value and
   self-efficacy, SRL in the form of persistence, task strategies,
   self-evaluation, and self-satisfaction, student engagement, performance,
   and goal attainment. In Study 1, a two (MCII, no MCII) by two (prompt,
   no prompt) between-subjects controlled experiment was conducted in an
   online video-based learning environment. Results showed that learners
   who completed the MCII had more sustained task value and higher
   persistence than learners who did not receive the MCII. Study 2 was
   conducted in five Massive Open Online Courses where we compared three
   conditions: MCII, goal only, and control. Results showed that there were
   no significant differences in SRL activities, course engagement and
   performance, and goal attainment among the three conditions.
   Collectively, the results suggest that the task duration in which
   learners' goals can be attained (e.g., within one short session or over
   multiple weeks) might influence the effectiveness of MCII.},

Abstract = {The growing popularity of flipped classes in higher education indicates
   mounting support of instructional strategies that integrate active
   learning (AL) techniques to help develop students' responsibility and
   control of their own learning through multiple ways of active classroom
   engagement with course content to which they have been given first
   exposure outside the classroom. The results of a trial of flipped
   lessons designed to enhance learning in an undergraduate college algebra
   course through out-of-class lecture videos followed by in-class
   problem-solving with discussion and practice exercises were described in
   the author's presentation in INTED 2016 {[}1].
   Following the case-study approach, the current paper builds on the data
   from the previous flipped lesson (FL) module trial, to explore the
   potential value of the data trace on the learning management system
   (LMS) that housed all course content accessed by the student cohort.
   Using learning analytics approaches, information about students'
   learning behaviour during the study period, which had been automatically
   collected and archived by the LMS, were extracted and utilized to
   further inform the study findings and to provide additional insight into
   the learning affordances, beyond what was evidenced by the brief online
   survey and the assessment results as affirmation of student satisfaction
   with using FL with integrated video in the college algebra course.
   Learning analytics data mined from the LMS perform a potential
   beneficial function towards the formulation of student-specific learning
   recommendations that optimize the student's mode of self-learning
   through consideration of metrics on motivation, time investment and
   preferences in learning strategies. The study displayed positive
   indications that implementation of the flipped class pedagogy using
   integrated videos enhances learning in the undergraduate college algebra
   course. Nonetheless, a caveat on conclusions and inferences from this
   study concerns design limitations in this small trial experiment.},

Title = {A Randomized Controlled Trial of Video Education versus Skill
   Demonstration: Which Is More Effective in Teaching Sterile Surgical
   Technique?},

Abstract = {Background: Video education has many advantages over traditional
   education including efficiency, convenience, and individualized
   learning. Learning sterile surgical technique (SST) is imperative for
   medical students, because proper technique helps prevent surgical site
   infections (SSIs). We hypothesize that video education is at least as
   effective as traditional skill demonstration in teaching first-year
   medical students SST. Methods: A video series was created to demonstrate
   SST
   (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcRU-gvOmxE2mwMWkowouBkxGXkLZ8Ui
   s). A randomized controlled trial was designed to assess which education
   method best teaches SST: video education or skill demonstration.
   First-year medical students (n=129) were consented and randomly assigned
   into two groups: those who attended a skill demonstration (control
   group; n=70) and those who watched the video series (experimental group;
   n=59). The control group attended a pre-existing 90-minute nurse
   educator-led skill demonstration. Participants then completed a 30-item
   multiple choice quiz to test their knowledge. Each group then received
   the alternate education method and completed a 23-item follow-up survey
   to determine their preferred method. Results: Seven 2- to 6-minute
   videos (30 minutes total) were created on surgical attire, scrubbing,
   gowning and gloving, and maintaining sterility. The experimental group
   (n=51) scored higher on the quiz compared with the control group (n=63)
   (88\%1\% versus 72\%+/- 1\%; p<0.0001). Students preferred the videos
   when it came to convenience, accessibility, efficiency, and review, and
   preferred the skill demonstration when it came to knowledge retention,
   preparedness, and ease of completion. Conclusions: Video education is
   superior to traditional skill demonstration in providing medical
   students with knowledge of SST. Students identified strengths to each
   method of teaching. Video education can augment medical students'
   knowledge prior to their operating room experience to ensure that a
   sterile environment is maintained for patients. The ultimate goal is to
   reduce SSIs.},

Abstract = {Anti-drug education is one of the important and necessary educational
   activities for young people. In this paper, a virtual reality based
   (VR-based) material for learning anti-drug skills is proposed. By using
   the learning material, learners are exposed in a virtual unsafe drug
   situation, and can feel the dangerousness seriously to learn the harms
   and risks of drug abuse while improving their abilities to refuse drugs.
   In order to evaluate the proposed material, it was compared with a
   video-based learning material which has the same contents with the
   VR-based learning material. Experiments were conducted and the results
   were analyzed from the aspects of effect on the users' attitudes, users'
   satisfaction, and anti-drug self-efficacy. As the result, it became
   clear that learners can learn effectively with the VR-based learning
   material more than with the video-based learning material.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is critical for student success in online
   postsecondary education. Many technology-based interventions have been
   studied to improve SRL skills, but few were situated in broad-access
   institutions that disproportionately serve systemically marginalized
   student populations in STEM fields. This study presents preliminary
   findings from a rapid-cycle evaluation that tests two
   technology-supported instructional strategies (videos and prompts)
   designed to improve SRL in online learning. Using finegrained
   clickstream data from 141 students across ten sections of five courses
   taught at a minority-serving community college, we generate measures of
   SRL behavior and correlate them with students' exposure to tested
   strategies. Our results indicate modestly positive relationships between
   both videos and prompts and SRL behavior. In addition, prompts are more
   strongly correlated with SRL behavior for first-generation and female
   students than for their peers. These initial findings reveal the promise
   and complexity of implementing effective and equitable
   technology-supported interventions to develop SRL skills and mindsets
   among diverse student populations in online STEM education.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To analyze the content, reliability, and quality of the most
   viewed YouTube videos targeting patients with ostomies intending to
   learn about ostomy care (OC).
   METHODS: Using the keywords ``stoma care,{''} ``colostomy care,{''} and
   ``ileostomy care,{''} researchers assessed the publicly visible
   English-language ostomy patient education videos available on YouTube. A
   total of 84 videos were independently analyzed by two physicians
   experienced in OC. Data on video characteristics, source, content,
   reliability, and quality were collected and recorded for each video
   separately.
   RESULTS: Of the 84 videos analyzed, 49 were classified as useful
   (58.33\%) and 35 as misleading (41.66\%). There were statistically
   significant differences between the groups in terms of the time elapsed
   since upload (P <.017), reliability (P <.001), comprehensiveness (P
   <.001), Global Quality Scale scores (P <.001), source (P <.001), and
   lecturer types (P <.011). The reliability, comprehensiveness, and Global
   Quality Scale scores were statistically higher for videos uploaded by
   universities, professional healthcare communities, and nonprofit
   physicians (P <.001). However, the popularity of the OC videos posted on
   YouTube was not related to their reliability, comprehensiveness, or
   quality.
   CONCLUSIONS: The open-access nature of the YouTube platform may impair
   patient education video quality and accuracy. YouTube may be an
   additional educational tool for OC, but clinicians need to be familiar
   with specific and reliable resources to guide and educate new patients
   with ostomies to achieve the best outcomes.},

Abstract = {This paper investigates the students' self-regulated learning in
   elementary education when traditional teaching method, which is teacher
   centered in a classroom, is replaced with a blended approach enriched
   with open educational resources. Various open educational resources such
   as videos, simulations, and learning games are readily available on the
   Web. In addition, mobile and classroom technologies, such as portable
   devices can be considered as teaching tools in education. The good use
   of these educational resources and technologies can not only assist
   students' formal classroom learning but also cultivate the
   self-regulated learning of students. The i-Classroom implemented in an
   elementary school adopted a new teaching method, which made use of the
   online educational resources and information technology, to achieve this
   goal. Three surveys (Sample size N = 149, N = 168, N = 150) were
   conducted to investigate the effectiveness of promoting three key
   aspects of self-regulated learning: learning motivation, planning and
   management, and self-monitoring. Focus group interviewed was also
   carried out to collect the feedback in i-classroom learning. The results
   show that i-Classroom can help students to enhance their ability in
   self-regulated learning.},

Abstract = {Video object segmentation (VOS) is one of the most fundamental tasks for
   numerous sequent video applications. The crucial issue of online VOS is
   the drifting of segmenter when incrementally updated on continuous video
   frames under unconfident supervision constraints. In this work, we
   propose a self-teaching VOS (ST-VOS) method to make segmenter to learn
   online adaptation confidently as much as possible. In the segmenter
   learning at each time slice, the segment hypothesis and segmenter update
   are enclosed into a self-looping optimization circle such that they can
   be mutually improved for each other. To reduce error accumulation of the
   self-looping process, we specifically introduce a metalearning strategy
   to learn how to do this optimization within only a few iteration steps.
   To this end, the learning rates of segmenter are adaptively derived
   through metaoptimization in the channel space of convolutional kernels.
   Furthermore, to better launch the self-looping process, we calculate an
   initial mask map through part detectors and motion flow to
   well-establish a foundation for subsequent refinement, which could
   result in the robustness of the segmenter update. Extensive experiments
   demonstrate that this ST idea can boost the performance of baselines,
   and in the meantime, our ST-VOS achieves encouraging performance on the
   DAVIS16, Youtube-objects, DAVIS17, and SegTrackV2 data sets, where, in
   particular, the accuracy of 75.7\% in J-mean metric is obtained on the
   multi-instance DAVIS17 data set.},

Abstract = {The Covid-19 pandemic has disrupted traditional approaches to education
   and forced educators to adopt and adapt technologies to allow
   institutions to remain open, offer courses and other services to enable
   students to continue their education. This rapid shift to online
   teaching and learning has shone a light on the need for institutions to
   support students in working out how to maintain autonomy through
   meaningful interaction in the online world. In this paper we discuss the
   transition of a face-to-face university writing center to a synchronous
   online writing center that is hosted in the video conferencing
   application Zoom. In doing this we explain the rationale that informed
   our thinking throughout the transition process and how sound pedagogical
   principles and a focus on the student experience guided our
   decision-making. Preliminary findings regarding how self-regulated
   learning was maintained and nurtured in the virtual writing center are
   presented and discussed.},

Abstract = {Our aim in this study was to examine, via technical performance analysis
   and speed of execution, whether information processing and technical
   knowledge help explain learning benefits of self-controlled video
   feedback in children's weightlifting performance. We randomized 24
   children (aged 10 to 12 years) into self-controlled (SC) and yoked (YK)
   feedback groups. Learners underwent test sessions one week before
   (pre-test) and one day after (post-test) six weightlifting training
   sessions. During each test session, we recorded kinematic parameters of
   snatch performance using Kinovea version 0.8.15 software. After the
   learning sessions, the SC group improved on most kinematic parameters
   (e.g., the horizontal displacement of the bar between the first and the
   second pulls {[}M-DXV = 25.42\%, SD = 18.96, p = 0.003) and the maximum
   height reached by the bar (M-HMV = 5.51\%, SD = 7.71, p < 0.05)], while
   the YK group improved only on the DxV (M-DXV = 19.08\%, SD = 24.68, p <
   0.05). In addition, the SC group showed a more advanced phase of
   cognitive processing compared to the YK group, and the SC group showed a
   superior improvement in their technical knowledge level (p < 0.001)
   compared to the YK group (p < 0.05). Thus, key elements to correcting
   motor errors in children's weightlifting through self-controlled
   feedback were improvements in information processing and technical
   knowledge.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},

Abstract = {Purpose Student engagement is typically measured by class attendance and
   questionnaires. Learning management systems (LMS) provide additional
   sources of objective data that can evaluate student performance. This
   study compared dental students' self-report of course video viewing with
   LMS data.
   Methods Dental students in a 2018 flipped pediatric dentistry course
   were given a questionnaire after course completion that captured
   self-reported course video viewing. Student data and time spent on
   videos were extracted from the LMS and matched to the questionnaire.
   McNemar's test evaluated differences between self-reported and matching
   LMS data.
   Results Of the 109 enrolled students, 99 (91\%) completed the
   questionnaire. Most students self-reported that they watched more than
   half of the videos (71\%), re-watched at least once (89\%), and watched
   at times other than 8 a.m.-5 p.m. (80\%). Of the 104 students with data
   from the LMS, 40\% of students watched more than half of the videos,
   49\% re-watched at least one video, and 60\% watched between 8 a.m.-5
   p.m. LMS data showed 14 (13\%) students did not watch any videos.
   Significant differences were found between self-reported video viewing
   and matched LMS video data in (1) percentage of videos watched, (2)
   number of times videos were re-watched, and (3) most frequent time for
   watching the videos (p < 0.001 for all).
   Conclusion Technology is a tool that helps instructors more accurately
   track students' study habits compared to observation or self-report.
   When evaluating time spent watching videos via an LMS, students tend to
   overestimate the amount of viewing time.},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Technological advancements and lower production costs since the
   mid-1990s have dramatically improved opportunities for instructors to
   tailor self-made instructional videos for their students. However, video
   production technology has outpaced the development of educational
   theory, causing instructional videos to consistently fall short of their
   pedagogical potential. Responding to these shortcomings, scholars from
   various backgrounds have started publishing guidelines to help
   practitioners as they develop instructional videos for their respective
   fields. Using a rapid literature review, this article contributes to
   this ongoing effort by synthesizing theory-based, best-practice
   guidelines for a specific subcategory of educational videos called
   supplemental instructional videos (SIVs). SIVs are different from other
   types of instructional videos in that they are used to support and
   magnify other learning methods, mediums, and materials rather than
   substitute for them. Bringing the best-practice guidelines synthesized
   in this paper immediately into application, they were used to inform the
   production of SIVs for an undergraduate course that was held in the
   Building Construction Department of a major public university in the
   United States during the Spring 2020 semester. The methods used in the
   production of the SIV guidelines were systematically documented during
   the course for future researchers and practitioners to learn and build
   from.},

Abstract = {Video question answering (VideoQA) is a challenging video understanding
   task that requires a comprehensive understanding of multimodal
   information and accurate answers to related questions. Most existing
   VideoQA models use Graph Neural Networks (GNN) to capture
   temporal-spatial interactions between objects. Despite achieving certain
   success, we argue that current schemes have two limitations: (i)
   existing graph-based methods require stacking multi-layers of GNN to
   capture high-order relations between objects, which inevitably
   introduces irrelevant noise; (ii) neglecting the unique self-supervised
   signals in the high-order relational structures among multiple objects
   that can facilitate more accurate QA. To this end, we propose a novel
   Multi-scale Self-supervised Hypergraph Contrastive Learning (MSHCL)
   framework for VideoQA. Specifically, we first segment the video from
   multiple temporal dimensions to obtain multiple frame groups. For
   different frame groups, we design appearance and motion hyperedges based
   on node semantics to connect object nodes. In this way, we construct a
   multi-scale temporal-spatial hypergraph to directly capture high-order
   relations among multiple objects. Furthermore, the node features after
   hypergraph convolution are injected into a Transformer to capture the
   global information of the input sequence. Second, we design a
   self-supervised hypergraph contrastive learning task based on the node-
   and hyperedge-dropping data augmentation and an improved question-guided
   multimodal interaction module to enhance the accuracy and robustness of
   the VideoQA model. Finally, extensive experiments on three benchmark
   datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MSHCL compared with
   stat-of-the-art methods. (c) 2023 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated whether acting as a peer model for a
   video-based modeling example, which entails studying a text with the
   intention to explain it to others and then actually explaining it on
   video, would foster learning and transfer. In both experiments, novices
   were instructed to study a text, either with the intention of being able
   to complete a test (condition A), or being able to explain the content
   to others (condition B and C). Moreover, students in condition C
   actually had to explain the text by creating a webcam-video. In
   Experiment 1 (N = 76 secondary education students) there was no effect
   of study intention on learning (A = B), but explaining during video
   creation significantly fostered transfer performance (C> B; C > A). In
   Experiment 2 (N = 95 university students), study intention did have an
   effect on learning (C > A; B > A), but only actual video creation
   significantly fostered transfer performance (C > A). (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Self-supervised learning methods have shown significant promise in
   acquiring robust spatiotemporal representations from unlabeled videos.
   In this work, we address three critical limitations in existing
   self-supervised video representation learning: 1) insufficient
   utilization of contextual information and lifelong memory, 2) lack of
   fine-grained visual concept alignment, and 3) neglect of the feature
   distribution gap between encoders. To overcome these limitations, we
   propose a novel memory-enhanced predictor that leverages key-value
   memory networks with separate memories for the online and target
   encoders. This design enables the effective storage and retrieval of
   contextual knowledge, facilitating informed predictions and enhancing
   overall performance. Additionally, we introduce a visual concept
   alignment module that ensures fine-grained alignment of shared semantic
   information across segments of the same video. By employing coupled
   dictionary learning, we effectively decouple visual concepts, enriching
   the semantic representation stored in the memory networks. Our proposed
   approach is extensively evaluated on widely recognized benchmarks for
   action recognition and retrieval tasks, demonstrating its superiority in
   learning generalized video representations with significantly improved
   performance compared to existing state-of-the-art self-supervised
   learning methods. Code is released at

Abstract = {In the last decades, evolution of information and communication
   technologies have been promoting adaptation of new learning and teaching
   styles. Normal lab execution is conducted using laborious lab manual.
   Using video visualization as teaching aid together with lab manual in
   our case is to enhance the teaching and learning of laboratory courses.
   Furthermore, lack of facilities, staff, resources, fund and time
   constraint or even scheduling issue may hinder the effectiveness of
   traditional hands-on experiments by lab manual. This paper describes the
   design and implementation of two biochemical engineering lab,
   sterilization intended for students at Bachelor degree. The video is not
   intended to replace the hands-on experiments using lab manual. Instead
   its objective is to facilitate further the execution of hands-on
   experiments by video demonstration. The students were able to watch the
   hands-on experiments and its procedure prior to the execution of the
   actual experiments as many times required. The students were exposed to
   questionnaire at pre-exposed to lab manual), post- (exposed to lab
   manual and video), and overall (completed experiments) stage to evaluate
   cognitive, affective and psychomotor aspects of its implementation. Most
   of students agreed that the lab video presentation is easier to
   understand and self-explanatory compared to lab manual alone. This
   results indicate that video as visualization aid on top of lab manual
   for experiments execution in biochemical engineering lab is an excellent
   medium to promote better teaching and learning on student sides. Student
   becomes more confident, independent, can execute the experiments faster
   and can relate to the real equipment better. At teachers' or
   demonstrator side, this video lessened student dependency on them,
   better impartment and engagement of knowledge with students. On overall,
   the use of the video promises many positive outcomes particularly to
   promote TVET based education.},

Abstract = {As a teaching and learning medium, 360 degrees videos offer new
   teaching-learning experiences. Through the possibility of immersion,
   individual 360 degrees panoramic images, multi-perspective viewing
   options and interaction possibilities, they extend the advantages of
   conventional video technology. To understand the potential of using 360
   degrees video technology for educational processes, a systematic
   literature review analyzed previous scientific articles (N = 44) about
   the interdisciplinary use of 360 degrees videos according to PRISMA
   guidelines. In the systematic literature selection, particular emphasis
   was placed on the conceptual distinction between virtual reality and 360
   degrees videos. By the authors, 360 degrees videos are understood as a
   specific video format that has characteristics of virtual reality but is
   to be distinguished from virtual reality by the necessary real recording
   situation without programmed virtual environments. The results show a
   use of 360 degrees videos mainly for three teaching-learning purposes:
   presentation and observation of teaching-learning content, immersive and
   interactive theory-practice mediation, and external and self-reflection.
   Combined with the added value of conventional video technology and other
   immersive technology such as virtual reality, five added value
   categories for its use as a teaching-learning medium were identified: To
   increase learning motivation and interest, to learn in authentic and
   realistic learning scenarios, for immersive and interactive learning
   experiences, for multi-perspective observation opportunities and for
   individual learning. These consisted primarily of positive motivational
   effects for authentic or immersive learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Developing one's own teaching streaming video could be an expensive and
   time consuming task, while using already available video could be easier
   and inexpensive. When searching for video clips for teaching purposes,
   you can consider television broadcaster on-line resources, or websites
   such as YouTube, Vimeo or TeacherTube, which can be very useful. For
   engineering education purposes, it could be useful to search in relevant
   Educational Digital Libraries such as NEEDS or MERLOT, where streaming
   video could be considered within the general category of digital
   courseware. However, high level technical and/or educational videos at
   these websites are very scarce. This paper presents a review on
   educational streaming video that can be used as teaching materials for
   thermal solar energy courses. The scope of the search is limited to
   thermal solar systems for the production of domestic hot water or space
   heating in buildings. Contents cover solar system descriptions,
   lectures, maintenance topics, self-made solar collectors, commercial
   videos and professional items. These materials could be useful, in
   e-learning and b-learning approaches, for Mechanical Engineering or
   Building Engineering courses interested in empowering the use of
   renewable energies in buildings, accordingly to the new European Union
   directive on Nearly Zero Energy Buildings (Directive 2010/31/EU on the
   energy performance of buildings). These videos can be integrated in many
   Learning Content Management Systems of any Faculty of Engineering.},

Abstract = {This study delves into Japanese for Specific Purposes (JSP) in Japanese
   language education, adapting to the evolving landscape of language
   learners' preferences. I propose a self-learning system that leverages
   YouTube videos, catering to individual interests. Unlike traditional
   approaches, our system enables autonomous learning by allowing learners
   to select preferred Japanese YouTube videos, emphasizing necessary
   vocabulary and grammar. Using cookingrelated videos as a case study, I
   analyze vocabulary usage through corpus-based methods. The analysis
   revealed that while a general vocabulary presentation showing a
   bilingual translation is sufficient for high-frequency words that
   commonly appear in multiple videos, it is required to present the
   characteristic words of each video along with meta-knowledge such as
   collocations of words, clich \& eacute;s, and technical terms. This
   study underscores the potential of digital resources for personalized
   language education, aiming to democratize access to language learning.

Abstract = {The production of video lectures for e-learning courses are becoming
   irreplaceable component of distance courses and getting more popular.
   The key feature of using video lectures is flexible opportunities to
   make learning independent from time and location. Moreover, video
   lectures promote to the better comprehension of learning material and
   motivate self-education of students.
   The purpose of using video lectures for e-learning courses is to
   increase the effectiveness of learning through visualization.
   Visualization of learning process minimizes cognitive difficulties of
   students. Synthesis of body language, verbal, and visual elements
   (multimedia, abstract signs, visual schemes, specific objects, etc.)
   within the limits of one e-learning course unit is an instrument of
   optimization of the process of semantic perception and understanding
   text information.
   Thus, the aim of the study is to develop the system of criteria to be
   considered when developing video lectures for e-learning courses and to
   give guidelines to teaching staff how to design and to implement video
   lectures within different training courses.
   After analysis the number of multimedia educational content of leading
   Russian and foreign universities, we develop the system of criteria for
   defining the recommendations of video lectures usage in teaching
   process: recommendations for clothing, external appearance,
   recommendations on the language of lectures and style of behavior.},

Abstract = {BackgroundVideo conferencing learning offers a more accessible and
   flexible learning mode for students who cannot attend face-to-face class
   in person. However, research about the video conferencing learning is
   still lacked, especially for students' engagement in this
   setting.ObjectivesThis study adopts the self-system model of
   motivational development to uncover effects of the video conferencing
   learning environment (VCLE) to students' engagement.MethodsTwo hundred
   and ninety-eight primary school students involved in the VCLE were
   surveyed. The partial least square structural equation modelling was
   employed to explore the link between the VCLE and students' engagement
   with a mediating role of basic psychological needs satisfaction
   (BPNS).Results and ConclusionsResults showed that the BPNS played a
   mediating role in the processes from the VCLE to engagement. Both
   pedagogical and social affordance had a significant effect on the BPNS.
   However, their influences were different. Specifically, pedagogical
   affordance yielded a stronger effect on the BPNS for autonomy than
   social affordance. The predicting power of social affordance on BPNS for
   relatedness and competence was stronger than pedagogical affordance.
   Generally, social affordance yielded more contributions to behavioral
   and emotional engagement than pedagogical affordance. Moreover, BPNS for
   competence was the only significant mediator between the VCLE and
   behavioral engagement, and it owned the strongest mediating power on the
   relationship between the VCLE and emotional engagement, followed by
   autonomy, and the smallest of relatedness. This study suggests that
   practitioners and researchers should give more consideration to improve
   social affordance of the VCLE and to meet students' BPNS especially for
   competence in order to design and implement an engaged video
   conferencing course.
   What is already known about this topicVideo conferencing learning
   provides an accessible and flexible learning mode.Mechanism from
   learning environment to engagement is helpful to design an engaged video
   conferencing course.Less is known about how video conferencing learning
   affects students' engagement.This study uncovered the functioning
   process of video conferencing learning to students' engagement.PLS-SEM
   was employed to verify the mediating role of BPNS in this process.BPNS
   for autonomy, competence, and relatedness played mediating roles and
   their powers were different.Implications for practice and/or policyMore
   attention is needed to improve to social affordance to enhance students'
   emotional engagement.BPNS especially for competence deserves special
   consideration to improve students' behavioral and emotional engagement.},

Abstract = {Video-based learning is widely used today in both formal education and
   informal learning in a variety of contexts. Videos are especially
   powerful for transferable skills learning (e.g. communicating,
   negotiating, collaborating), where contextualization in personal
   experience and ability to see different perspectives are crucial. With
   the ubiquity of widely available video content, video-based learning is
   seen as one of the main strategies to provide engaging learning
   environments. However, numerous studies show that to learn effectively
   while watching videos, students need to engage actively with video
   content. We have developed an active video watching platform (AVW-Space)
   to facilitate engagement with video content by providing means for
   constructive learning. The initial studies with AVW-Space on
   presentation skills show that only students who commented on videos and
   who rated comments written by their peers have improved their
   understanding of the target transferable skill. In order to foster
   deeper engagement, we designed a choice architecture and a set of nudges
   to encourage students to engage deeper. We conducted two studies
   investigating the effect of nudges. The results provide evidence that
   the initial set of implemented nudges is effective: the students who
   received nudges wrote more comments, used different aspects, and there
   were more students who wrote comments. The nudges were particularly
   helpful for undergraduate students who were less experienced in
   self-regulated learning. Future work includes designing additional
   nudges to enhance student engagement by improving the quality of
   comments and by encouraging participation in collaborative activities.},

Abstract = {Engineers today must be able to communicate and collaborate in teams.
   They also must be comfortable making adjustments within the team to
   maintain flow and progress toward project goals. With these goals in
   mind, students in a first-semester engineering seminar course were asked
   to videotape a team meeting in their design course and to write a
   self-reflection paper after viewing their video. After analyzing the
   video, students were asked to provide clear suggestions in their
   self-reflection paper for improving their own and their team's
   performance. Our preliminary analysis showed that video-supported
   reflections: 1) may be more effective than memory for identifying
   problems within the team; 2) can encourage detailed analysis about
   students' interactions with each other; 3) can be used to help provide
   feedback on each student's and the teammates behaviors; and 4) can be an
   efficient tool for generating an effective problem-solving environment.},

   the learner. The package provided hardcopy and web based information, an
   in-house produced audio-video tape demonstrating BLS. and open access to
   manikins in a Skills Centre where the students learnt in pairs. Students
   determined when they were ready to be assessed. This assessment was
   performed by two independent observers using the Resuscitation Council
   (UK) BLS assessment sheet. Two groups. comprising in total 51 fourth
   year medical Students were assessed, 47 were found to be competent in
   performing BLS on their first assessment. Of the remaining four, three
   were assessed as competent after further self-directed learning and
   retesting, Only one student required personal tutoring prior to success.
   Self-directed learning is a successful method of mastering BLS, Where
   failure occurred, it was due to inadequate student learning in the
   Skills Centre. The importance of practice needs emphasis in future use

   Our results indicate that video playback facilitates student teacher
   learning and that the quality of reflection ranges from routine to

Journal = {ACTIVE LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 30},
Abstract = {Although discussion is widely used as an effective instructional
   strategy in the classroom, the questions remain about which additional
   strategies can be combined to discussion. The present study aims to
   examine the role of self-study as an individual preparation for
   discussion and the learning effect of the combination of self-study and
   discussion. We compared a two-sequential design of groups: individual
   preparation (video lecture vs. self-study) and type of discussion
   (teacher-facilitated vs. student-led). We compared the test scores for
   shallow learning and transfer of learning. Conducting two experiments
   (n1 = 91; n2 = 113, respectively), we found that the self-study group
   obtained higher scores than those of the video lecture group regardless
   of discussion type. Specifically, the self-study group obtained higher
   scores through student-led discussions, while lecture groups improved
   scores through teacher-facilitated discussion. To interpret the results,
   we analyzed the content of discussions. The result demonstrated that
   students in the self-study group conducted more constructive
   interactions with students than they did with teachers, while the video
   lecture group interacted more with teachers than they did with students.
   The findings indicate that self-study as individual preparation improves
   the learning effect of discussion.},

Abstract = {IntroductionThe instructional video is considered to be one of the most
   distinct and effective virtual learning tools. However, one of its
   biggest drawbacks is the lack of social interaction that occurs. This
   study tested the impact of participants sending zero danmaku (sending
   messages on the screen), three danmaku sending, and unlimited danmaku as
   an instructional video plays on learning performance. MethodsWe assessed
   learners' retention and transfer scores, as well as self-report scores
   for cognitive load and parasocial interaction. This study sample
   comprised 104 participants who were randomly assigned to learn from one
   of three instructional videos on the topic of the heart. ResultsThe
   results showed that sending danmaku improved learners' parasocial
   interaction, while significantly increasing their cognitive load and
   also hindering learning performance. The observed increase in cognitive
   load reported by learners was also caused by increased levels of
   parasocial interaction. DiscussionOur findings suggest that by sending
   danmaku, learners can promote interactive learning, but that this has a
   negative impact on learning performance and the process of video
   learning.},

Title = {Comparative study of 360° virtual reality and traditional

   focusing on learning satisfaction and self-efficacy},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Background Acquiring adequate theoretical knowledge in the field of
   dental radiography (DR) is essential for establishing a good foundation
   at the prepractical stage. Currently, nonface-to-face DR education
   predominantly relies on two-dimensional (2D) videos, highlighting the
   need for developing educational resources that address the inherent
   limitations of this method. We developed a virtual reality (VR) learning
   medium using 360 degrees video with a prefabricated head-mounted display
   (pHMD) for nonface-to-face DR learning and compared it with a 2D video
   medium.Methods Forty-four participants were randomly assigned to a
   control group (n = 23; 2D video) and an experimental group (n = 21; 360
   degrees VR). DR was re-enacted by the operator and recorded using 360
   degrees video. A survey was performed to assess learning satisfaction
   and self-efficacy. The nonparametric statistical tests comparing the
   groups were conducted using SPSS statistical analysis software.Results
   Learners in the experimental group could experience VR for DR by
   attaching their smartphones to the pHMD. The 360 degrees VR video with
   pHMD provided a step-by-step guide for DR learning from the point of
   view of an operator as VR. Learning satisfaction and self-efficacy were
   statistically significantly higher in the experimental group than the
   control group (p < 0.001).Conclusions The 360 degrees VR videos were
   associated with greater learning satisfaction and self-efficacy than
   conventional 2D videos. However, these findings do not necessarily
   substantiate the educational effects of this medium, but instead suggest
   that it may be considered a suitable alternative for DR education in a
   nonface-to-face environment. However, further examination of the extent
   of DR knowledge gained in a nonface-to-face setting is warranted. Future
   research should aim to develop simulation tools based on 3D objects and
   also explore additional uses of 360 degrees VR videos as prepractical
   learning mediums.},

Abstract = {Effective oral presentation skills are essential in educational, social,
   and professional life. Although the advantages of the focused
   self-monitoring strategies on language learning are theoretically sound,
   the empirical evidence on EFL graduate students' oral presentation
   performance is limited. The study explored the effects of focused
   self-monitoring and general self-monitoring, actualized by videotaping
   and implementing e-Portfolio, on graduate students' English oral
   presentation performance. 48 students enrolled in the graduate program
   were randomly assigned into two self-monitoring conditions. English oral
   presentations were videotaped and uploaded to e-Portfolio. Students in
   the focused self-monitoring group were asked to observe the video clips
   with a list of important criteria of the presentation, whereas students
   in the general self-monitoring group viewed the performances without the
   list. The findings showed that students in the focused self-monitoring
   group outperformed their counterparts in the general self-monitoring
   group on the English oral presentations of their thesis proposal defense
   rehearsals. In addition, self-monitoring enhanced students'
   self-efficacy and use of self-regulated learning strategies. With regard
   to the effects of self-monitoring on students' learning motivation, no
   significant difference was found and students in both groups showed
   positive attitudes toward the training process of self-monitoring and

Abstract = {Given the increasing number of learners in massive open online courses
   (MOOCs), students' self-directed learning (SDL) skills are necessary for
   their success. The purpose of this study was to explore learners'
   motivation for enrolling in MOOCs and their SDL strategies, as well as
   instructional elements that support SDL from learners' perspectives.
   This qualitative study adopted a phenomenological research design. The
   data source was semi-structured interviews with 15 learners from three
   MOOCs. The data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The researchers
   found that the motivation for enrolling in MOOCs included intrinsic
   motivation (e.g., curiosity, improving personal knowledge, and personal
   interest) and extrinsic motivation (e.g., supporting formal education
   and career development). The learning strategies used by MOOC learners
   were task strategies, self-monitoring, and self-management strategies.
   The task strategies included taking notes, reading texts or subtitles,
   watching videos, and conducting further research. The self-monitoring
   strategies included self-assessment, self-reflection, progress
   indicators, final projects, and authentic tasks. Learners'
   self-management strategies (e.g., time management and resource
   management) varied depending on their diverse motivations. In addition,
   the instructional elements that support SDL were self-assessment and
   discussion forums, instructor feedback, flexibility, clearly stated
   learning goals, the authenticity of the content, and small learning
   units. The implications of the study are discussed in the paper.},

Abstract = {Aim of the study: To investigate whether pure self-learning without
   instructor support, resulted in the same BLS-competencies as
   facilitator-led learning, when using the same commercially available
   video BLS teaching kit.
   Methods: First-year medical students were randomised to either BLS
   self-learning without supervision or facilitator-led BLS-teaching. Both
   groups used the MiniAnne kit (Laerdal Medical, Stavanger, Norway) in the
   students' local language. Directly after the teaching and three months
   later, all participants were tested on their BLS-competencies in a
   simulated scenario, using the Resusci Anne SkillReporter (TM) (Laerdal
   Medical, Stavanger, Norway). The primary outcome was percentage of
   correct cardiac compressions three months after the teaching. Secondary
   outcomes were all other BLS parameters recorded by the SkillReporter and
   parameters from a BLS-competence rating form.
   Results: 240 students were assessed at baseline and 152 students
   participated in the 3-month follow-up. For our primary outcome, the
   percentage of correct compressions, we found a median of 48\%
   (interquartile range (IQR) 10-83) for facilitator-led learning vs. 42\%
   (IQR 14-81) for self-learning (p= 0.770) directly after the teaching. In
   the 3-month follow-up, the rate of correct compressions dropped to 28\%
   (IQR 6-59) for facilitator-led learning (p= 0.043) and did not change
   significantly in the self-learning group (47\% (IQR 12-78), p= 0.729).
   Conclusions: Self-learning is not inferior to facilitator-led learning
   in the short term. Self-learning resulted in a better retention of
   BLS-skills three months after training compared to facilitator-led
   training.},

Abstract = {This study aims to explore the perspectives of pre-service teachers
   (PSTs) regarding their experiences with the ANNOTO personal note feature
   within a blended learning (BL) context. Employing qualitative research
   methods, the analysis incorporates reflections from 45 PSTs, insights
   derived from two focus groups, and data gathered through semi-structured
   interviews. The objective is to comprehend how PSTs engaged with
   ANNOTO's personal note during their learning experiences and how they
   perceived its role in shaping their professional development. The
   findings underscore a predominantly positive experience among PSTs, with
   their perceptions linked to heightened motivation and meaningful
   learning. Additionally, the study identified three distinct annotating
   styles-annotating throughout watching, annotating after watching, and a
   combination of both-each associated with enhanced concentration, memory
   prompting, and improved writing skills. Furthermore, PSTs articulated
   professional insights related to teacher and student agency,
   encompassing themes such as the use of video as a teaching tool, active
   learning, self-directed learning, scaffolding, critical thinking, and
   temporal considerations aligned with students' needs. The principal
   implications center on the necessity of engaging in discussions with
   PSTs regarding the integration of hyper-video and the pedagogical
   approaches it may endorse.},

Title = {Does instructor's image size in video lectures affect learning outcomes?},

Abstract = {One of the most commonly used forms of video lectures is a combination
   of an instructor's image and accompanying lecture slides as a
   picture-in-picture. As the image size of the instructor varies
   significantly across video lectures, and so do the learning outcomes
   associated with this technology, the influence of the instructor's image
   size should be evaluated. This study tested the effect of image size of
   the instructor on learners' experience of social presence, cognitive
   load, learning performance and satisfaction. In the study, 87 Chinese
   undergraduates were randomly assigned to view a video lecture with a
   small image of the instructor, with a medium image size of the
   instructor or with a large image of the instructor. The results of
   analyses of variances and analysis of covariance suggested that learners
   perceived the same level of social presence and cognitive load across
   video lectures with different image sizes of the instructor; learners
   who watched the video lecture with the small image of the instructor
   learned better than those who watched the video lectures with the medium
   and the large images of the instructors. Furthermore, learners who
   watched the video lecture with the small image and medium image of the
   instructor experienced more learning satisfaction. The findings
   highlight the importance of image size of the instructor in video
   lecture learning.},

Pages = {1809-1822},

Abstract = {This study tested whether seeing others' typed messages while viewing
   video lectures affected learners' attention and learning performance.
   Participants viewed one of three versions of a video lecture: (a)
   conventional video lecture as control; (b) video lecture with others'
   programmed messages appearing onscreen when the instructor was giving
   demonstrations on course content; (c) video lecture with others'
   programmed messages appearing onscreen when the instructor was posing
   questions. In Experiment 1, participants viewed video lectures without
   pause and could not post messages themselves. Eye tracking data revealed
   that although seeing others' messages did not decrease learners'
   attention to the learning content in the video, greater attention to
   others' messages was associated with lower retention. Furthermore,
   learners who viewed the conventional video lecture showed higher
   transfer than those who viewed either of the video lectures that
   included others' messages. In Experiment 2, participants viewed
   self-paced lectures and could post messages themselves. Experiment 2
   duplicated the results of Experiment 1 in a realistic educational
   setting. Overall, these findings suggest that seeing others' messages
   during a video lecture has negative effects on learners' attention and
   learning.},

Abstract = {Online and blended learning have increased drastically during the
   pandemic, and their popularity has persisted as we emerge from this
   global crisis. This study aims to adapt and validate the Online Learning
   Readiness Scale (OLRS) to assess high school students. Secondary school
   students were recruited (n=296) for the study. The OLRS scale included.
   five components: Technology Readiness, Learner Control, Online
   Communication Self-efficacy, Self-directed Learning and Motivation for
   Leaming. Results supported the OLRS scale in terms of reliability and
   internal construct validity in context of the study by confirmatory
   factor analysis and Rasch measurement with partial credit analysis. The
   differential item functioning analysis revealed no bias issues regarding
   gender, confirming the measurement invariance statistics achieved. The
   study also found that the majority of students (73.7\%) engaged in
   online learning solely through their mobile phone. ICT familiarity,
   i.e., interacting with friends regularly, browsing online learning
   materials, and watching educational videos on YouTube, had a positive
   association with students' readiness for online learning. Students'
   access to social networks, online forums and online music did not have a
   significant effect on their readiness for online learning. The scale
   demonstrated the capacity to function as an assessment instrument for
   evaluating readiness for online learning in the context of secondary
   education. Educational implications were considered, including key
   requirements of supporting technology and pedagogical practice in online
   and blended learning environments.},

Abstract = {Deep learning is a data-hungry technique that is more effective when
   being applied to large datasets. However, large-scale annotation
   datasets are not always available. A new approach, such as
   self-supervised learning of which labels can be automatically generated,
   is essential. Therefore, using self-supervised learning is a new
   approach to state-of-the-art methods. In this paper, we introduce a new
   self-supervised method namely video denoising. This method requires an
   autoencoder model to restore original videos. The second model is
   proposed, which is called the discriminator. It is used for the quality
   evaluation of output videos from the autoencoder. By reconstructing
   videos, the autoencoder is learned both spatial and temporal relations
   of video frames to process the downstream task easily. In the
   experiments, we have demonstrated that our model is well transferred to
   the action recognition task and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on
   the UCF-101 and HMDB-51 datasets.},

Abstract = {Overcrowding is exceptionally unfortunate when performing laboratory
   experiments that require an important theoretical background. Although
   theoretical concepts are taught in the classroom, when students arrive
   at the laboratory they are not able to perform the experiments on their
   own. What is more, they even do not know how to start. Thus, anything
   that can be done to help the students to understand the experimental
   procedures that they have to follow should be given the highest
   priority. In this sense, the Universidad Politecnica de Valencia has
   developed the Plan Docencia en Red, a program with the purpose of
   supporting the elaboration and use of multimedia learning material
   (videos and others).
   The educational video was aimed for first year students of the Grado en
   Biotecnologia (Biotechnology Degree). In particular, the video will be
   used in the laboratory sessions of the course Termodinamica y Cinetica
   Quimica (Thermodynamics and Chemical Kinetics). In this course, the
   ratio students / instructor is too high, which makes very difficult to
   give an individual support in the laboratory. The study of the
   equilibrium liquid-vapour in the water-ethanol system was chosen as the
   topic for the educational video. The experimental procedure to obtain
   the diagram of equilibrium for mixtures of ethanol-water was described,
   together with the theoretical background. The video was filmed in the
   laboratory and it is available in the Politube platform. The present
   communication describes the process of planning and filming the video.
   The next step to be undertaken is to recommend the students to use the
   video and evaluate its impact on their learning process by means of
   their final marks.},

Abstract = {The aim of the study was to examine the determining factors of students'
   video usage and their learning satisfaction relating to the
   supplementary application of educational videos, accessible in a Moodle
   environment in a Business Mathematics Course. The research model is
   based on the extension of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), in which
   the core TAM constructs - perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use,
   attitude - and internet self-efficacy were included as the explanatory
   factors of video usage. As regards the determinants of learning
   satisfaction, beside the core TAM constructs, the role of learning
   performance, learner-learner interaction, and learner-teacher
   interaction was examined. Data were collected from 89 students using a
   questionnaire, on which the partial least-squares structural equation
   modelling approach was used to evaluate the research model. The results
   confirmed that perceived usefulness, attitude, and internet
   self-efficacy had a direct effect on the video usage. Learning
   satisfaction was directly influenced by learner-learner interaction,
   perceived ease of use, and learning performance. Furthermore, the
   results indicated that video usage had a significant effect both on
   learning performance and on learning satisfaction. The findings show
   that the extended TAM model can be applied for predicting the university
   students' video technology usage and their learning satisfaction

Abstract = {Anakinra is a drug that can be administered subcutaneously as a
   self-injection in both children and adults. We aimed to evaluate the
   content, reliability, and quality of the videos most viewed on
   ``anakinra self-injection{''} on YouTube, which is an easily accessible
   source of information. We performed a YouTube search using the keywords
   ``anakinra{''}, ``anakinra injection{''}, and ``anakinra
   self-injection{''} in addition to the generic and commercial names of
   the biologic agent in September 2021. The quality and reliability of the
   videos were assessed according to the Global Quality Score (GQS) and
   DISCERN score. Video power index was used to assess both the view and
   the like ratio of the videos. A total of 51 videos were analyzed, a
   majority of which were uploaded by physicians (56.9\%). The median GQS
   was 3 and total DISCERN score was 49. According to the GQS, 21.6\% of
   the videos were of low quality, 35.3\% were of fair quality, and 43.1\%
   were of high quality. High-quality videos had higher DISCERN scores and
   longer duration of videos (p < 0.05). 41 (80.4\%) videos were
   categorized as useful information, and 8 (15.7\%) as useful as per
   patients' opinion. Further, GQS and DISCERN scores of videos that had
   useful information were significantly higher. There are numerous YouTube
   videos with helpful information that can be a source of knowledge on the
   safe and correct technique of daily anakinra self-injection for both
   adults and children. There was no significant difference in patient
   interaction between useful and misleading videos. This indicates that
   patients do not differentiate between high- and low-quality videos.},

Abstract = {This study measured the effects of playing commercial video games on the
   development of the desirable skills and competences sometimes referred
   to as `graduate attributes'. Undergraduate students in the Arts and
   Humanities were randomly assigned to either an intervention or a control
   group. Previously validated, self-report instruments to measure
   adaptability, resourcefulness and communication skill were administered
   to both groups. The intervention group played specified video games
   under controlled conditions over an eight week.period. A large effect
   size was observed with mean score change 1.1, 1.15, and 0.9 standard
   deviations more positive in the intervention group than the control on
   the communication, adaptability, and resourcefulness scales respectively
   (p = 0.004, p = 0.002, and p = 0.013 for differences in groups by
   unpaired t-test). The large effect size and statistical significance of
   these results support the hypothesis that playing video games can
   improve self-reported graduate skills. The findings suggest that such
   game-based learning interventions have a role to play in higher
   education. Crown Copyright 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {Video lectures form a primary part of MOOC instruction delivery design.
   They serve as gateways to draw students into the course. In going over
   these videos accumulating knowledge, there is a high occurrence of cases
   {[}1] where the learner forgets about some of the concepts taught and
   focus more on what is the minimum amount knowledge needed to carry
   forward to attempt the quizzes and pass. This is a step backward when we
   are concerned with giving the learner a learning outcome that seems to
   bridge the gap between what he knew before and after the course to
   completion. To address this issue, we are proposing an interaction model
   that enables the learner to promptly take notes as and when the video is
   being viewed. The work contains a functional prototype of the
   application for taking personalized notes from MOOC contents. The work
   {[}12] is an integration of several world leading MOOC providers content
   using application program interface(API) and a customize interface
   module for searching courses from multiple MOOC providers as COURSEEKA
   and personalised note taking module as MOOKbook. This paper largely
   focuses on a learner's perspective towards video based lectures and
   interaction to find the enhancements in interaction with longer
   retention of MOOC contents.},

Title = {Learning From Online Instructional Videos Considering Video Presentation
   Modes, Technological Comfort, and Students Characteristics},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 4},
Abstract = {Although much is known about the importance of video-based instruction
   for learning STEM online, how the instructor is presented in the video
   and how this impacts student reactions and learning remains largely
   under-explored, especially considering students' backgrounds. Thus, we
   examined the relations between students' backgrounds - specifically,
   comfort with technology and gender - and video presentation mode on
   learning from instructional STEM videos presented online. Using a mixed
   method design across two studies, we measured students' accurate recall
   of STEM content, enjoyment, and attitude. Study 1 (n = 70) examined
   content from a computer programming course, and Study 2 (n = 60)
   replicated and expanded the first with content from a statistics course,
   and with additional videos and additional outcome measures. Results
   indicated that students' comfort with technology was associated with
   learning outcomes, gender was sometimes associated with attitudes, but
   presentation mode did not impact outcomes. These studies have
   implications for course design, understanding and supporting student
   learning online, and future research.},

Abstract = {Modern trends in teaching and learning aim to use effective methods by
   which students better understand the learning material and are more
   involved in the learning process. These methods should take into account
   the ability of today's students to work multifunctional and quickly
   process large amounts of information. The introduction of modern
   technology in the classroom is the most important change in education
   now. This article examines ways to provide specialized medical
   information in an intriguing interactive way, geared towards effective
   support for medical students. The paper presents new methods included in
   the training of medical students in Bulgaria: Video algorithms that show
   didactically in detail the necessary sequence of actions to perform a
   particular medical manipulation, including everything they need to know
   and can make the student achieve this skill. In order to better master
   the series of actions involved in the manipulation and the acquisition
   of preliminary experience, it is proposed to include Simulation Games in
   the medical training. The use of Serious Simulation Games in medical
   training helps to improve the skills of future medics and to build
   self-confident specialists.},

Title = {Watch vs do: A randomized crossover design evaluating modified simulated
   patients and video learning for novice speech-language therapy students},

Abstract = {BackgroundSimulated learning activities are an effective tool for
   reducing speech-language therapy (SLT) students' anxiety and improving
   their confidence for clinical placements. Such activities include
   interacting with patients who are actors, clinical educators or peers
   and are known to decrease anxiety and increase confidence in SLT
   students. Screen-simulated patients using video are another alternative,
   which has not yet been fully evaluated in the education of SLT students.
   AimsTo compare the effectiveness of (1) modified simulated patient and
   (2) video simulated learning for increasing self-reported (a) confidence
   and (b) preparedness and (c) decreasing self-reported anxiety. Methods
   \& ProceduresThis study used a randomized crossover design with 127
   first-year graduate-entry master's SLT student participants. Students
   participated in two activities related to a clinical interaction with a
   paediatric client's carer: (1) a 1-hr modified simulated patient
   experience with clinical staff as the simulated patient; and (2) a
   video-learning task, with two videos of a clinician-carer interaction
   and an accompanying worksheet. Students were randomly allocated to a
   group of four students and the groups randomly allocated to receive
   modified simulated patient or video-learning first. Students were not
   blinded to the activities. The students completed a 19-item
   questionnaire at three time points: before either activity, after the
   first activity and after the second activity, to evaluate their
   self-reported confidence, clinical preparedness and anxiety. Outcomes \&
   ResultsA total of 62 students completed modified simulated patient first
   and 63 completed video-learning first. After either single activity the
   students had significantly increased confidence and preparedness scores,
   while only the modified simulated patient significantly reduced student
   anxiety scores. As a second activity, modified simulated patient
   resulted in further significant improvements in confidence, preparedness
   and anxiety; however, adding video learning as a second activity
   resulted in no significant benefit. Conclusions \& ImplicationsThis
   study demonstrates the effectiveness of two low-resource
   clinical-learning activities for novice SLT students that can be applied
   in a range of settings. Of the two activities, modified simulated
   patient had greater effectiveness, as it was the only activity to
   decrease anxiety. An investigation of the pedagogical principles within
   the activities revealed that modified simulated patient activity had
   more opportunities for peer learning, supervisor feedback and verbal
   reflection in comparison with video learning that may explain the
   increased benefits. What This Paper AddsWhat is already known on the
   subjectSimulated learning activities are an effective teaching tool for
   SLT students, increasing confidence and decreasing anxiety in
   preparation for placement. Simulated patients require more resources
   than video simulation. Both simulated patients and video simulation
   provide a safe learning environment, where students can learn without
   risk to clients. What this paper adds to existing knowledgeThis study is
   among the first to investigate a modified version of simulated patients;
   our modification involves a clinical educator performing the role of
   both the simulated patient and simulation facilitator. It is the first
   to evaluate simulation via video learning for SLT students.
   The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of these two activities, and
   the slight advantage of modified simulated patient, for increasing
   novice students' confidence and preparedness and decreasing their
   anxiety about clinic. It also unpacks the pedagogical principles used in
   each activity to explain the reasons that modified simulated patient had
   greater effectiveness. What are the potential or actual clinical
   implications of this work?The two educational activities required no
   specialist equipment and can be applied in a range of pre-clinical and
   clinical settings by university staff and/or community clinical
   educators. Increasing confidence and preparedness, and decreasing
   anxiety will help ensure that student learning on scarce clinical
   placements is maximized.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Self-assessment is important to learning but few studies
   have utilized video self-assessment of basic surgical skills. We
   compared a video self-assessment of suturing and knot tying skills by
   novice trainees to the assessment by a senior attending surgeon.
   METHODS: Sixteen senior medical students and 7 beginner surgical interns
   were video-recorded while performing five suturing and knot tying tasks.
   All videos were analyzed using an objective structured assessment of
   technical skills (OSATS) metrics (1-5 scale; 1 = novice, 5 = expert).
   Video self-assessment was carried out within 4 weeks of an instructional
   session and subsequently by one senior surgery instructor (blinded to
   the individual). Both a Global score and total combined OSATS scores
   were analyzed. Total possible OSATS scores were: interrupted suture-30,
   subcuticular closure-30, one and two-handed knot tying-25 each, tying in
   a restricted space 20; maximum combined score-130 points). Confidence
   levels in performing the tasks pre-test and the value of video
   self-assessment were rated on a 1-5 Likert scale (1 = low and 5 = high).
   Data are mean +/- SD and statistical significance was evaluated using
   Friedman's test.
   RESULTS: Self-assessment scoring was significantly higher than the
   assessment by a senior instructor for three tasks by global score and
   all five tasks by combined OSATS score (self-assessment 71.8 +/- 16.7 vs
   attending assessment 56.7 +/- 11.0, p = 0.007). Mean self-assessment
   Global scores ranged from 2.5 to 2.8 for all tasks performed compared to
   1.8-2.3 for attending surgeon assessment (p<0.05). Confidence levels
   demonstrated no correlation to performance speed or proficiency. The
   video self-assessment was rated as a highly valuable (mean 4.3 +/- 0.8)
   component to skills training.
   CONCLUSIONS: Novice trainees over-estimate their basic technical skills
   performance compared to the assessment by a senior surgeon. Video
   self-assessment may be a valuable addition to a pre-residency and
   surgical internship preparatory curriculum in basic suturing and knot
   tying. (J Surg 70:279-283. (C) 2013 Association of Program Directors in

Abstract = {Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) provide different
   opportunities to students with intellectual disabilities and to
   professionals who work with them. However, few studies address the use
   of collaborative learning platforms and handheld devices to enhance the
   integration of people with intellectual disabilities in the labour
   market. We present a learning experience where active methodologies,
   such as collaborative work, are combined with the use of iPads and a
   learning management system following a video self-modelling methodology.
   The goal of this study was to determine whether the combination of
   traditional methodologies and new could be appropriate for students with
   intellectual disabilities and how they behave when having to rate their

   of pre-service teachers' co-construction of shared knowledge},
Journal = {LEARNING CULTURE AND SOCIAL INTERACTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {41},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {In this design-based study first-year pre-service teachers
   co-constructed video-based mind maps as part of a pedagogy course. The
   students produced self-made group videos and uploaded them to a joint
   platform before working with peers' group videos in a mind map
   structure. The course topic was learning sciences research, and the goal
   was to create a shared understanding about the course content before an
   upcoming exam. The study has been grounded in a sociocultural
   perspective on human activity and learning, employing interaction
   analysis to investigate how digital tools can support students'
   collaborative reading and understanding of key concepts in academic
   literature. By scrutinising video recordings of both in-room and
   on-screen activities, we analyse how five groups of pre-service teachers
   collaborated during the co-construction of videos, and how they
   interacted with fellow students' group videos. Findings demonstrate that
   the stu-dents interacted intently with each other's work and constituted
   the mind map as a point of convergence and resource for meaning making
   and collaboration within the student class com-munity. The study shows
   that video-based mind maps can provide material and social structures
   for collaboration and that fellow students' group videos formed
   knowledge objects that generated in-depth conversations among peers
   about the subject matter.},

Abstract = {Background Engaging students in computer-assisted guided inquiry
   learning has great potential to scaffold their scientific understanding:
   Students are expected to improve their scientific problem-solving
   skills, and at the same time gain a deep conceptual understanding of the
   subject-matter. Additional generative activities such as creating video
   explanations subsequent to inquiry learning activities can also further
   deepen students' knowledge. Objectives In this experiment, we therefore
   compared the effectiveness of computer-based direct instruction (to
   mimic traditional classroom teaching) versus computer-based inquiry
   learning. Methods University students (N = 118) either received
   video-based direct instruction (direct instruction), including the
   demonstration of a virtual experiment, or conducted the virtual
   experiment themselves supported by prompts (inquiry learning). A third
   group of students additionally generated a video explanation as
   consolidation activity subsequent to conducting the virtual experiment
   (inquiry learning + generative activity). Results and Conclusions
   Contrarily to our hypotheses, the direct instruction condition
   outperformed the inquiry learning conditions. There were no significant
   differences between the inquiry learning and the inquiry learning +
   generative activity condition. Moderation analyses revealed that the
   effectiveness of direct instruction predominantly held true for students
   with low levels of domain-specific self-concept. All in all, our present
   study contributes to a better understanding of effects of direct
   instruction versus guided inquiry learning in computer-based science
   education settings. Importantly, our findings show that the
   effectiveness of instructional approaches may depend on students'
   domain-specific self-concept as a motivational prerequisite. As such it
   is up for further research in science education to identify motivating
   instructional strategies to enhance students' learning.},

Abstract = {One of the most effective ways of involving students in the learning
   process is content-based project delivery which promotes meaningful
   student engagement into the learning process. Integration of project
   work into the course instruction creates such a learning environment
   that spurs active student involvement, stimulates higher level thinking
   styles, develops self-study skills and makes students feel responsible
   for the outcome of their learning process. It also lays grounds for
   students' self-organization and self-education and thus shapes life-long
   learning skills for continuous self-development.
   This paper aims to illustrate the successful strategies that were used
   to impulse the learning process by integrating project work into
   content-based instruction within the course ``Education context and
   reform in Kazakhstan{''} as one of its main assignments and students'
   creative approach to its fulfilment on the example of a filmed cartoon
   video used as a technology tool for presentation of their project
   results.
   The goal of the project-based assignment was to arouse students'
   interest and motivation in analytical and creative approach to acquiring
   and broadening their knowledge and skills by fulfilling a semester-long
   group project. Students were requested to construct a summary of their
   detailed answers to course questions aimed at defining and indicating
   key stakeholders, main reforms and policy documents, achievements and
   problems in implementing the educational reforms at all the levels of
   education and future directions based on the readings for the sessions
   and their discussion in class in a visual format of their choice: mind
   map, table, poster, video. The project results illustrated in this paper
   demonstrate the creative approach of one group of students who
   visualized the development of Kazakhstani education system as a journey
   where a bus with passengers presenting key stakeholders moves along
   ``the education road{''} and filmed it by using paper, plastic materials
   at hand, digital camera and Windows Movie Maker program for cutting and
   editing the video files.
   The value of the project, however, lies not just in the final product
   that students produced but in the process of working towards the end
   point. It resulted in developing good team-work skills, building student
   confidence and autonomy as well as improving students' creative skills,
   cognitive abilities and deeper content comprehension by their engagement
   in design, problem solving, decision making, and investigative
   activities as well as technology use. Active roles of the students
   revealed through this project work of the real world problems resulted
   in a great experience for them, high level of their satisfaction with
   both technology use and subject content comprehension and feeing of
   involvement into the professional aspects of their career.
   We hope that teacher educators and students will be able to adapt the
   ideas presented here to enhance their teaching and learning process and
   see that such kind of project - based learning can be fun, inspiring,
   challenging, pedagogically valuable, and more importantly, beneficial
   for both teachers and students.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The provision of simulation to enhance learning is becoming common
   practice as clinical placement becomes harder to secure within Bachelor
   of Nursing programs. The use of simulation videos within a blended
   learning platform enables students to view best practice and provides
   relevant links between theory and practice. Four simulation videos
   depicting family assessment viewed by a cohort of Australian
   undergraduate nursing students were evaluated. These videos were
   professionally developed using actors and experienced family nurses.
   Surveys were used to explore the students' self-assessed knowledge,
   confidence and learning preferences before and after exposure to blended
   learning resources. Students' engagement with the simulated videos was
   captured via the Learning Management System.
   Time 1 survey was completed by 163 students and Time 2 by 91 students.
   There was a significant increase in students' perceived knowledge of
   family theory Item 1 from a mean 4.13 (SD = 1.04) at Time 1 to 4.74 (SD
   = 0.89) (Z = 4.54 p < 0.001) at Time 2; Item 2-Knowledge of family
   assessment improved from mean 3.91 (SD = 1.02) at Time 1 to 4.90 (SD =
   0.67) (Z = 7.86 p < 0.001) at Time 2. Also a significant increase in
   their confidence undertaking family assessment Item 5 from a mean 3.55
   (SD = 1.14) at Time 1 to 4.44 (SD = 0.85) (Z = 6.12 p < 0.001) at Time
   2. The students watched the videos an average of 1.9 times.
   The simulated videos as a blended learning resource increases the
   students' understanding of family assessment and is worth incorporating
   into future development of courses.},

Abstract = {Background: Computer-based video training (CBVT) provides flexible
   opportunities for surgical trainees to learn fundamental technical
   skills, but may be ineffective in self-directed practice settings
   because of poor trainee self-assessment. This study examined whether
   CBVT is effective in a self-directed learning environment among novice
   trainees.
   Methods: Thirty novice trainees used CBVT to learn the 1-handed square
   knot while self-assessing their proficiency every 3 minutes. On reaching
   self-assessed skill proficiency, trainees were randomized to either
   cease practice or to complete additional practice. Performance was
   evaluated with computer and expert-based measures during practice and on
   pretests, posttests, and 1-week retention tests.
   Results: Analyses revealed performance improvements for both groups (all
   P < .05), but no differences between the 2 groups (all P > .05) on all
   tests.
   Conclusions: CBVT for the 1-handed square knot is effective in a
   self-directed learning environment among novices. This lends support to
   the implementation of self-directed digital media-based learning within
   surgical curricula. (c) 2007 Excerpta Medica Inc. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning has a positive effect on academic outcomes;
   however, little is known about whether and how teachers at various
   education levels promote it in their classes. Video-based classroom
   observations were conducted to assess primary and secondary school
   mathematics teachers' direct and indirect promotion of self-regulated
   learning (SRL). Teachers' implicit and explicit instruction of SRL
   strategies (direct promotion of SRL) and the learning environment they
   created (indirect promotion of SRL) were rated according to how
   conducive they were to self-regulation. In addition, semi-structured
   interviews were conducted with the secondary school teachers to gain
   insight into their subjective views on SRL. Although the teachers'
   instructional practices could foster SRL, teachers spent little time
   explicitly teaching SRL strategies. Moreover, they taught mainly
   cognitive strategies and very few metacognitive strategies. These
   results were more pronounced at the primary level than at the secondary
   level. Primary school teachers provided learning environments conducive
   to self-regulation more often than secondary school teachers did. The
   interviews revealed that the teachers lacked knowledge about
   metacognition as an important component of SRL and were rather reluctant
   to promote it; however, most of them valued cognitive and motivational
   components of SRL. Primary and secondary school teachers need training
   to enhance their direct and indirect instruction of SRL. They could
   benefit in particular from learning about explicit instruction of SRL
   strategies and metacognition.},

Abstract = {Compressing videos into binary codes can improve retrieval speed and
   reduce storage overhead. However, learning accurate hash codes for video
   retrieval can be challenging due to high local redundancy and complex
   global dependencies between video frames, especially in the absence of
   labels. Existing self-supervised video hashing methods have been
   effective in designing expressive temporal encoders, but have not fully
   utilized the temporal dynamics and spatial appearance of videos due to
   less challenging and unreliable learning tasks. To address these
   challenges, we begin by utilizing the contrastive learning task to
   capture global spatio-temporal information of videos for hashing. With
   the aid of our designed augmentation strategies, which focus on spatial
   and temporal variations to create positive pairs, the learning framework
   can generate hash codes that are invariant to motion, scale, and
   viewpoint. Furthermore, we incorporate two collaborative learning tasks,
   i.e., frame order verification and scene change regularization, to
   capture local spatio-temporal details within video frames, thereby
   enhancing the perception of temporal structure and the modeling of
   spatio-temporal relationships. Our proposed Contrastive Hashing with
   Global-Local Spatio-temporal Information (CHAIN) outperforms
   state-of-the-art self-supervised video hashing methods on four video
   benchmark datasets. Our codes will be released.},

Abstract = {This study explored using video self-analysis as a practice to help
   teachers identify effective problem-based learning (PBL) instruction and
   identify areas for their professional growth. Five seventh-grade
   teachers in the United States who varied in age, gender, ethnicity, and
   years of experience video-recorded their PBL instruction. Teachers then
   engaged in a semi-structured reflection protocol. The Modified
   Metacognitive Coach Checklist (MCC-M) supported teachers in this
   reflection. Researchers conducted an inductive analysis of the
   transcripts, which is consistent with the constant comparative method.
   Data analysis showed positive outcomes in promoting long-term changes in
   beliefs, pedagogy, and in the lives of diverse students when teachers
   use a specific model of PBL instruction focused on increasing equity in
   outcomes, and as a driver for reflective practice using video
   self-analysis.},

Abstract = {With the exponential growth of the use of technology in both the
   educational setting as well as in healthcare, the use of video recorders
   has been identified as an effective teaching and learning tool. One of
   the main advantages of video recording is that it can provide the
   learner with immediate feedback on the skills they have practiced. In
   the nursing arena competency in clinical skills is essential for the
   safe and competent practitioner. The challenge for many nurse educators
   is to develop an educational approach that combines the skills of self-
   assessment with those of psychomotor skill development.
   In this paper, the researchers present a qualitative descriptive case
   study that analyses the reflections of nursing students using Point of
   View (POV) video glasses at a University in Western Australia. Students
   reviewed their performance of a simple wound dressing through video
   playback of audio and visual recording of their practice. Reflection on
   the use of this teaching and learning tool identified a number of
   emerging themes including: increased self- awareness, reflection on
   learning and the development of critical thinking skills.},

Abstract = {An innovative blended-learning strategy is presented for the subject
   Laboratory of Elasticity and Strength of Materials, based on the use of
   different tools combining face-to-face methods with e-learning
   technologies to improve learning outcomes in Mechanical Engineering. The
   enhanced teaching environment includes upgraded teaching material, new
   self-assessment methods, and video clips providing detailed instructions
   for each practical session. Our challenge was to improve the learning
   method by changing from a model that simply presents the practical
   sessions to a model that actively involves students in the learning
   process. The results of an anonymous student satisfaction survey show
   that these improvements have been very well received; students consider
   that the new techniques are very useful both for better understanding
   the subject and for preparing for the oral exam. Rates of success
   demonstrate that the improvements have had a direct and significant
   impact on performance, as well as reducing the dropout rate. As an
   overall conclusion, we can state that all the new techniques are
   effective tools for improving learning outcomes in the Degree in
   Mechanical Engineering.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Online learning from video modeling examples, in which a human model
   demonstrates and explains how to perform a learning task, is an
   effective instructional method that is increasingly used nowadays.
   However, model characteristics such as gender tend to differ across
   videos, and the model-observer similarity hypothesis suggests that such
   characteristics may affect learning. Therefore, this study investigated
   whether the effectiveness of learning how to solve a probability
   calculation problem from video modeling examples would vary as a
   function of the model's and observer's gender. In a 2 (Model:
   Female/Male) x 2 (Observer: Female/Male) between-subject design, 167
   secondary education students learned how to solve probability
   calculation problems by observing video modeling examples. Results
   showed no effects of Model or Observer gender on learning and near
   transfer. Male students reported higher self-efficacy than female
   students. Compared to a female model, observing a male model enhanced
   perceived competence more from pretest to posttest, irrespective of
   observers' gender. Furthermore, learning from a male model was less
   effortful and more enjoyable for male students than for female students.
   These results suggest that gender of both model and observer can matter
   in terms of affective variables experienced during learning, and that
   instructional designers may want to consider this when creating (online)
   learning environments with video modeling examples.},

Abstract = {Background: Learning from video lectures with peers, that is, co-viewing
   video lectures, is a common mode of learning across a wide range of ages
   and topics in the information age.Objectives: The present study tested
   the effects of learners' motivation on co-viewing video lectures in
   terms of learning performance, mental effort, and interpersonal brain
   synchronization (IBS).Methods: The current study was quantitative
   experimental. In total, 142 participants were recruited and divided into
   71 dyads to manipulate task motivation from three aspects: meaning,
   interest, and reward. Then, they were divided into three experimental
   conditions according to the level of task motivation: two low task
   motivation learners (LL condition), a combination of one low and the
   other high (HL condition), and two high task motivation learners (HH
   condition). Two participants in a dyad were asked to view a video
   lecture on a shared screen and not talk until the end of the video
   lecture, with both learners in full view. Simultaneously, we recorded
   the cortical hemodynamic activity of two participants in each dyad using
   functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).Results and Conclusions:
   The group-level analysis showed that two high-task motivation learners
   had better learning performance, greater mental effort, and stronger IBS
   than a combination of one low and one high-task motivation and two
   low-task motivation. The results from the individual assessment
   indicated that pairing a person with low task motivation with another
   with high task motivation resulted in benefits for the low-task
   motivation learner in terms of their self-perceived learning. However,
   it negatively affected the performance of the high task motivation
   learner.},

   inhibited by external reward techniques. The author's experience as a
   professional game developer is that there are large commercial benefits
   and efficacy in a range of reward-based game mechanics. By identifying
   game design features that could cross over into education this paper
   will outline a range of techniques that could be implemented using a
   mobile device platform for use in the classroom within a higher
   education setting. An experiment is proposed to investigate the impact
   of this approach to games based learning and a software design is
   presented to support the experiment's aims. A meta-game is described
   that links into normal student activities, gamifying them to enhance the
   student experience.},

Title = {Model-observer similarity and task-appropriateness in learning from
   video modeling examples: Do model and student gender affect test
   performance, self-efficacy, and perceived competence?},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {89},
Pages = {457-464},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {In video modeling examples, a human model demonstrates and explains how
   to perform a task. The model-observer similarity (MOS) hypothesis
   predicts that learners who perceive themselves to be more similar to the
   model will learn more from the examples and show greater self-efficacy
   gains. Findings have been mixed, however; possibly because perceptions
   of task-appropriateness might affect learning and self-efficacy
   independently of similarity views. Therefore, we examined whether the
   effectiveness of modeling examples on troubleshooting electrical
   circuits, a task typically perceived as more appropriate for males than
   females, would differ as a function of the gender of the model and the
   observer. Secondary education students (N = 159) watched two video
   modeling examples, either by a male or a female model. The example
   content was kept equal. A manipulation check confirmed that students
   perceived same gender models as more similar to them than
   opposite-gender models. They also perceived the task as more appropriate
   for males than females. Males performed somewhat better than females and
   showed higher confidence gains; however, model'gender did not affect
   students' test performance, self-efficacy and perceived competence
   gains, effort investment, learning enjoyment, or perceived explanation
   quality. Our findings suggest that there is no need to take the model's
   gender into account when designing video modeling examples. (C) 2017

Title = {Can prompts improve self-explaining an online video lecture? Yes, but do
   not disturb!},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},

Abstract = {In recent years, COVID-19 policy measures massively affected university
   teaching. Seeking an effective and viable way to transform their lecture
   material into asynchronous online settings, many lecturers relied on
   prerecorded video lectures. Whereas researchers in fact recommend
   implementing prompts to ensure students process those video lectures
   sufficiently, open questions about the types of prompts and role of
   students' engagement remain. We thus conducted an online field
   experiment with teacher students at a German university (N = 124; 73
   female, 49 male). According to the randomly assigned experimental
   conditions, the online video lecture on topic Cognitive Apprenticeship
   was supplemented by (A) notes prompts (n = 31), (B) principle-based
   self-explanation prompts (n = 36), (C) elaboration-based
   self-explanation prompts (n = 29), and (D) both principle- and
   elaboration-based self-explanation prompts (n = 28). We found that the
   lecture fostered learning outcomes about its content regardless of the
   type of prompt. The type of prompt did induce different types of
   self-explanations, but had no significant effect on learning outcomes.
   What indeed positively and significantly affected learning outcomes were
   the students' self-explanation quality and their persistence (i.e.,
   actual participation in a delayed posttest). Finally, the self-reported
   number of perceived interruptions negatively affected learning outcomes.
   Our findings thus provide ecologically valid empirical support for how
   fruitful it is for students to engage themselves in self-explaining and
   to avoid interruptions when learning from asynchronous online video
   lectures.},

Journal = {LANGUAGE AND SOCIOCULTURAL THEORY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {147-174},
Abstract = {Much research exploring the use of videos to support language learning
   positions videos as tools and learners as passively engaged viewers.
   This study reveals that when encouraged to explore authentic Chinese
   videos, L2 learners actively took con-trol of their language learning
   based on their personal interests. The complexity of video learning
   calls for deeper exploration into learners' experiences. Using
   socio-cultural theory perspectives of self-, other-, and
   social-mediation and internaliza-tion, this article depicts heritage and
   non-heritage university-level Chinese language learners' agency during
   informal video learning. This two-year qualitative study used
   semi-structured interviews, stimulus recall, participant observation,
   and document collection. Analysis revealed these lived experiences of
   participants' agentic video learning; Learners in our study demonstrated
   variety in terms of social support and cultural understanding helping or
   hindering how videos mediated their L2 learning. Teachers should
   therefore design video pedagogy that considers individual students'
   social worlds and purposes for L2 learning.},

Title = {Exploratory analysis of an e-learning course based on micro-videos to
   improve the preparation of the undergraduate dissertation in Spanish
   context},
Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},

Abstract = {The Bologna Declaration (1999) and the implementation of the European
   Higher Education Area have opened a new panorama of learning. In Spanish
   Universities, an Undergraduate Dissertation (UD) is the final step on
   the developmental period of undergraduate students. However, there are
   usually no previous subjects during the undergraduate course that
   prepare the skills required at the UD, especially autonomy. Therefore,
   there are great difficulties for students. To end this training gap, a
   face-to-face training course was designed, and another one based on
   micro-videos was designed in 2019-2020. Based on the Self-Determination
   Theory, the aim was to know if a training course based on micro-videos
   is more effective for making students feel more prepared for UD, than
   the face-to-face method. A quasi-experimental method has been used with
   a comparative approach between groups. A mixed methodological approach
   has developed. For exploratory data analysis, independent two-sample
   t-tests and Pearson's bivariate correlations were performed. An
   hermeneutic analysis of the content of the interviews was carried out.
   All the students (n = 34) in both groups showed an improvement in the
   preparation to successfully pass the UD. The main difference found
   between the two modalities of the course was the more analytical and
   concrete organization. Qualitatively, more perceived autonomy was found
   in the micro-video group. However, the results were inconclusive. A
   blended modality could be considered in the future, with the most
   flexible and aesthetic structure of micro-videos but with the advantages
   of face-to-face communication.},

Title = {Effectiveness of donning and doffing personal protective equipment

   students},
Journal = {BMC NURSING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {OCT 3},
Abstract = {Background The use of appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) in
   healthcare settings is a very important factor of infection control
   activities to prevent transmission of infection. In this study, we aimed
   to develop a non-face-to-face method that can reduce transmission of
   infection and an educational method that allows self-learning and
   self-training, and verify the effectiveness of a donning and doffing PPE
   education using video debriefing on third-year nursing students in
   clinical train. Methods The researcher assigned groups through random
   sampling using a random number table from the list of research subjects
   who agreed to participate. Therefore, 35 subjects in the experimental
   group with an education on donning and doffing PPE using video
   debriefing and 34 subjects in the control group with video-based
   training (VBT) were participated in April 2023 at a university in
   Incheon, South Korea. The evaluation phase involved verifying effects of
   the education on observer evaluation donningand doffing PPE performance
   and self-evaluation donningand doffing PPE performance. Satisfaction
   with the education also assessed immediately after intervention by the
   experimental group. Results The experimental group had significantly
   higher scores for observer evaluationdonning (t = 7.84, p < .001) and
   observer evaluation doffing (t = 6.52, p < .001) PPE performances than
   the control group. However, there was no significant difference in
   self-evaluation donning (t = 0.98, p < .330) or doffing PPE performance
   (t = 0.17, p < .869) between the two groups. In the experimental group
   that applied video debriefing, learning satisfaction was 4.33 +/- 0.82
   points out of 5 points. Conclusions The education on donning and doffing
   PPE applying video debriefing was effective. If the education developed
   in this study is used as a self-learning method to improve the infection
   control capacity necessary to respond to a disaster crisis caused by
   infectious diseases, it is considered to be useful for preventing the
   transmission of infectious diseases in the future.},

   education: A systematic review},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objectives: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of peer
   video feedback (PVF) on healthcare students' reactions and learning
   outcomes against other feedback methods (e.g., expert- or self-video
   feedback). It also synthesized the characteristics of PVF within health
   professions education to identify its effective elements.
   Data sources: Seven databases were systematically searched to identify
   relevant studies, including CENTRAL, CINAHL, ERIC, Embase, PubMed,
   PsycINFO, and Scopus.
   Review methods: This review was conducted based on the PRISMA Statement
   Guidelines. Reviewers independently extracted data from the included
   articles and assessed the risk of bias and quality of the studies. The
   effectiveness of PVF on students' reactions, learning, and quality of
   peer feedback was summarized.
   Results: A total of 22 articles were included. Results showed PVF was a
   helpful learning tool, and students were satisfied with its overall
   learning experience. PVF demonstrated its positive effect on skill-based
   learning. The top concern was its quality (accuracy and content),
   ascribing to peers' limited knowledge, expertise, or feedback
   experience.
   Conclusions: This review affirmed the potential effect of PVF on
   skill-based learning but revealed students' ambivalent feelings towards
   its quality. Six effective elements were proposed for its best practice.
   Future studies are needed to investigate further these proposed elements
   and how they mediate the educational effects of PVF.},

Abstract = {This study aims to develop a predictive model for predicting gifted
   students' engagement levels and to investigate the features that are
   important in such predictions. Features reflecting students' emotions,
   social-emotional learning skills, learning approaches and video-watching
   behaviours were used in the prediction models. The study group consisted
   of 36 gifted students between the ages of 12 and 14 who attended an
   information technologies course, where students engaged with
   Arduino-based learning tasks. Data related to only one task were
   analysed. Prediction models were developed using different machine
   learning algorithms, and information gain scores were used to
   investigate important features in the prediction models. The results
   show that all prediction models achieved a higher classification
   accuracy than the base model. The highest classification accuracy (83\%)
   was achieved with the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Students'
   self-reported emotions while performing the task were found to be the
   most important feature in predicting their level of engagement. Other
   important features in predicting engagement level were the students'
   social-emotional learning skills, deep and surface learning approaches
   and their video-watching behaviours. As a result, it was found that the
   engagement level of gifted students could be predicted with high
   accuracy. These results can be used to predict students' engagement
   levels and to develop interventions for low-engaged students. The
   obtained results are discussed within the scope of emotion-aware
   learning design and social-emotional learning.},

Abstract = {Teacher education students, as an important reserve in the field of
   education, their growth and development are related to the future of
   science, economy, sustainable development of education. Through
   participation in the educational practice of STEAM, which integrates
   science, technology, engineering, art, and mathematics is more
   beneficial for them to acquire 21st century skills like communication,
   collaboration, learning innovation and critical thinking. However,
   little has been seen about the use and effectiveness of short videos in
   STEAM education activities and how they can be used to support and
   promote teacher education students STEAM learning performance and
   sustainable inquiry behaviors. Therefore, this study combines the
   framework of triadic reciprocity determinism theory and technology
   acceptance theory to propose six research hypotheses and develop a
   research model to explore the relationship between collaborative
   self-efficacy (CS-E), perceived usefulness (PU) of short videos,
   perceived ease of use (PEOU), STEAM learning performance and teacher
   education students' sustainable inquiry behavior. To achieve the purpose
   of this study, this study used purposive sampling and invited teacher
   education students from five classes of preschool education at a
   university in Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region (GZAR), China, to
   participate in this study. A total of 8 h of instructional guidance was
   provided over a four-week period, in which participants used short
   videos for collaborative group learning and independent inquiry and
   applied STEAM concepts to kindergarten science activities. Participants'
   STEAM performance was measured and surveyed during the fourth week. The
   results of the study validation showed that (1) teacher education
   students CS-E had a positive effect on the PU and PEOU of short videos;
   (2) Teacher's education students PEOU of short videos had a positive
   effect on usefulness; (3) Teacher's education students PU and PEOU of
   short videos had a positive effect on STEAM learning performance; (4)
   Teacher's education students' STEAM learning performance had a positive
   effect on sustainable inquiry behavior.},

Abstract = {A rising number of (online) learning scenarios feature video-based
   worked examples. We analyzed the effects of the presentation mode of
   worked examples on their effectiveness and efficiency in two experiments
   with university students (N-1 = 57; N-2 = 43). The students acquired
   argumentation knowledge by self-explaining different types of worked
   examples. In Experiment 1, we compared video-based examples with written
   examples, and in Experiment 2, we compared video-based examples with
   graphic novel-based examples. Regardless of the examples' presentation
   mode, we observed similar learning processes (i.e., invested mental
   effort and self-explanation quality) as well as a large effect on
   learning outcomes (i.e., conceptual knowledge about argumentative
   principles). Although they appear similarly effective, we found learning
   by self-explaining written examples and by self-explaining graphic
   novels to be less time consuming and, thus, more efficient than learning
   by self-explaining video examples.},

Abstract = {Currently, computer assisted learning and multimedia form a key part of
   teaching. Interactivity and feedback are valuable in promoting active as
   opposed to passive learning. The study is conducted as an assessment of
   the impact of immersive VR on learning gain compared with a
   non-immersive video capture of VR, with a primary research question
   focusing on exploring learning gain and a secondary question exploring
   user experience, whereby understanding this is paramount to recognizing
   how to achieve a complete and effective learning experience. The study
   found immersive VR to significantly increase learning gain whilst two
   key measures of reported experience; enjoyment and concentration, also
   appeared significantly higher for the immersive VR learners. The study
   suggests extensive avenues for further research in this growing field,
   recognizing the need to appeal to a variety of students' learning
   preferences. For educators, the relevance of self-directed and
   student-centered learning to enable active learning in the immersive
   tool is highlighted. Findings of such VR-based studies can be applied
   across several disciplines, including medical education; providing
   opportunity for users to learn without real-world consequences of error
   such as in surgical intervention.},

Title = {Effect of case study versus video simulation on nursing students'
   satisfaction, self-confidence, and knowledge: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {79},
Pages = {129-134},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Research on simulation in nursing education has demonstrated
   the positive impact active, experiential learning has on student
   satisfaction, self-confidence, and knowledge. As a result, simulation
   laboratories with high-fidelity human patient simulators have become a
   common adjunct to clinical teaching. It is important to also promote
   active learning in the classroom setting; however, there is limited
   evidence on using video simulations in large classrooms.
   Objectives: This study sought to determine if using a video simulated
   unfolding case study as part of the didactic classroom, as compared to a
   traditional written case study, improved students' satisfaction,
   self-confidence, and knowledge.
   Design: A two-group, quasi-experimental design was used.
   Settings: The study occurred at a University in the southeastern United
   States.
   Participants: A total of 165 baccalaureate nursing students
   participated.
   Methods: The control group received a written case study, while the
   intervention group received video simulation of the same case study and
   student satisfaction, self-confidence, and knowledge were measured upon
   completion. Data analysis used descriptive statistics and t-tests.
   Qualitative comments were also provided by students and analyzed for
   themes.
   Results: There were no statistically significant differences, with both
   groups reporting a high level of satisfaction and self-confidence. The
   percent of knowledge questions answered correctly was higher for the
   video simulation group for all seven questions. Four themes were
   identified from participant words: A better understanding, Able to apply
   learning to a patient scenario, Engaged in learning, and Visualizing it
   helps.
   Conclusions: Results suggest the use of video simulation in the
   classroom may deepen students' understanding of classroom content and
   provide an additional mode for learning to enhance classroom lecture.
   Use of video simulation to augment classroom teaching is suggested as a
   strategy for engaging learners.},

Title = {Hybridizing video-based learning with simulation for flipping the
   clinical skills learning at a university hospital in Pakistan},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 21},
Abstract = {BackgroundWhile learning and practicing on actual patients is a major
   mode of teaching clinical skills, concerns about patient safety,
   unavailability, and lack of standardization have led to the development
   of simulation for medical education. Simulation-based teaching is
   affected by challenges such as lack of protected time for faculty,
   inexperienced learners, and the number of students per group. These have
   led to the integration of various eLearning formats in the curriculum.
   The hybridized format changes the traditional clinical skills teaching
   into the flipped classroom. This study aims to measure the effectiveness
   of hybridizing video-based learning with simulation for flipping the
   clinical skills teaching of fourth-year medical students at the
   Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at Aga Khan University,
   Pakistan.MethodsThe study employed a mixed-methods design. Fourth-year
   medical students of the batch 2020-21 (n = 100) consented to participate
   in the study. The quantitative component focuses on identifying the
   effect of the intervention on the perceived self-efficacy of medical
   students (batch 2020-21) relevant to the clinical skill. Along with
   this, the performance of the intervention batch of 2020-21 on the end of
   clerkship objective structured clinical exam (OSCE) was compared with
   the previous batch of 2019-20, taught using simulation alone. Focused
   group discussions (FGDs) were used to explore the experiences of medical
   students (batch 2020-21) about the intervention. Quantitative data
   underwent descriptive and inferential analysis using Stata v16 while
   qualitative data underwent content analysis using NVivo
   software.ResultsHybridization of video-based learning with simulation
   significantly improved self-efficacy scores for all examinations
   (cardiovascular, respiratory, neurological, and abdomen) with p-value <
   0.05. OSCE scores of the intervention group were significantly higher on
   the neurological and abdominal stations as compared to the previous
   batch (p-value < 0.05). In addition, the overall structure of the
   intervention was appreciated by all the students, who stated it allowed
   reinforcement of basic concepts, retention, and further insight into
   clinical applications.ConclusionThe hybridization of video-based
   learning with simulation facilitated in creation of better opportunities
   for medical students to revive their prior knowledge, apply core
   concepts for the problem and engage in clinical reasoning.},

   risk students, low-achievers can benefit academically if they develop
   self-regulated learning skills. This paper investigates student and
   teachers' perception on Edpuzzle activities in supporting development of
   self-regulated learning skills among low-achievers. The participants of
   this study were 18 Chemistry students enrolled in the Australian
   Matriculation (AUSMAT) Programme at Sunway College, Malaysia. The
   distributed Edpuzzle activities comprise of five units, which contains
   video and quizzes located in parts of the video. Further, peer and
   teacher assistance were provided to support lowachievers' learning. A
   mixed method data collection technique was employed using a survey
   questionnaire which consists of closed-ended and open-ended questions,
   along with teacher reflective notes. Analysis of data revealed that the
   use of Edpuzzle permits a flexible environment to students which
   supports the development of self-regulated learning skills. Even though
   most low-achievers favoured the use of self-directed learning resources
   to support their learning, some were reluctant and preferred the
   face-to-face learning approach. On the whole, this study provides
   valuable insights on teacher preparation for low-achievers in
   encouraging them to become autonomous learners.},

Abstract = {The distance learning programmes at Universiti Sains Malaysia was
   established back in 1971 through the School of Distance Education.
   Various forms of technologies were used as part of the academic support
   system for its distance education learners. The School of Distance
   Education has evolved from using print-based media to computer-based
   media. Print based media in the form of printed lecture notes was first
   used when Universiti Sains Malaysia started its distance learning
   programmes. In the early 1980's self instructional modules were designed
   for the working adults studying at a distance. This was complemented
   with occasional visit to the study centres by the lecturers and the
   deployment of part time tutors at the study centres to conduct tutorials
   during the weekend. Due to the non availability of competent part time
   tutors and also the non uniformity of tutorials, audio teleconferencing
   was introduced in 1988. Lectures were conducted by the course lecturer
   direct from the main campus. However, science students have difficulty
   in understanding certain concept without visually seeing them. In 1991
   the School of Distance Education introduced the audio graphic
   teleconferencing to overcome the said problem. With the advancement of
   Information and Communication Technology (ICT) many changes and
   innovations were undertaken by the School of Distance Education in the
   delivery of instructions to its distance education learners. The ICT
   used consists of interactive live video conferencing, the Learning
   Management System, the learning object repository, the web-based e-Post
   and the web-based e-Assignment. Live video conferencing involves the
   live interactive transmissions of images, speeches, texts, graphics,

   Students can interact not only with their lecturer but also with their
   fellow students. The Learning Management System consists of an
   open-source Learning Management System which has more than 6,000
   students enrolled as users in over 220 courses. The learning object
   repository, in the form of video lectures and lecture notes enables
   students to gain access to course presentations regardless of spatial
   and temporal limitations. Other ICT used consists of the e-Post which is
   a student-friendly tracking system that ensures the accurate and timely
   delivery of learning materials. The e-Assignment is the tracking
   mechanism of student assignments that allows the efficient management of
   student course assignments. This paper traces Universiti Sains
   Malaysia's experience over a period of forty years in introducing
   various forms of technologies in enhancing and providing a high quality
   distance education programmes. Discussion focuses on the development
   process of each phase of implementation. It also discusses the impact of
   the usage of technologies on the community especially in meeting the
   objectives of each of the systems deployed, the sustainability plan and
   the commitment of the promoter.},

Title = {Instructing students on effective sequences of examples and problems:
   Does self-regulated learning improve from knowing what works and why?},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},

Abstract = {Nowadays, students often practice problem-solving skills in online
   learning environments with the help of examples and problems. This
   requires them to self-regulate their learning. It is questionable how
   novices self-regulate their learning from examples and problems and
   whether they need support. The present study investigated the open
   questions (1) to what extent students' (novices) task selections align
   with instructional design principles and (2) whether informing them
   about these principles would improve their task selections, learning
   outcomes, and motivation. Higher education students (N = 150) learned a
   problem-solving procedure by fixed sequences of examples and problems
   (FS-condition), or by self-regulated learning (SRL). The SRL
   participants selected tasks from a database, varying in format,
   complexity, and cover story, either with (ISRL-condition) or without
   (SRL-condition) watching a video detailing the instructional design
   principles. Students' task-selection patterns in both SRL conditions
   largely corresponded to the principles, although tasks were built up in
   complexity more often in the ISRL-condition than in the SRL-condition.
   Moreover, there was still room for improvement in students' task
   selections after solving practice problems. The video instruction helped
   students to better apply certain principles, but did not enhance
   learning and motivation. Finally, there were no test performance or
   motivational differences among conditions. Although these findings might
   suggest it is relatively `safe' to allow students to independently start
   learning new problems-solving tasks using examples and problems, caution
   is warranted: It is unclear whether these findings generalize to other
   student populations, as the students participating in this study have
   had some experience with similar tasks or learning with examples.
   Moreover, as there was still room for improvement in students' task
   selections, follow-up research should investigate how we can further
   improve self-regulated learning from examples and practice problems.},

Pages = {122-139},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the undergraduate students'
   adoption of video lessons. The data were collected from 313
   undergraduate students from Education, Health Sciences, and Letters
   Faculties within a large university in Turkey using a questionnaire with
   six constructs: ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, intention, computer
   self-efficacy and relative advantage. The Technology Acceptance Model
   and Diffusion of Innovation Theory were used as the research framework
   for the study, and the data were analysed by Structural Equation
   Modeling. The results showed that ease of use and computer self-efficacy
   had a significant influence on usefulness of video lessons. Computer
   self-efficacy had a significant influence on ease of use regarding video
   lessons and usefulness of a video lesson had a significant influence on
   relative advantage. In addition, relative advantage and enjoyment had a
   significant effect on student intention to use a video lesson.
   Interestingly, it was found that perceived ease of use, perceived
   usefulness, and computer self-efficacy had no effect on the intention to
   use video lessons. Consequently, five constructs account for 38\% of the
   variance intention to use video lessons. The research model was found to
   have a good fit.},

Abstract = {Video learning holds an important place in modern STEM classrooms, but
   more improvements to the learning experience are needed. In order to
   introduce active-learning components into assignments, questions are
   often deployed alongside videos. Unfortunately, many students tend to
   skip videos entirely and solely answer questions, bypassing valuable
   assigned content. Edpuzzle is an online video-modifying platform that
   allows instructors to take videos (both instructor-made as well as
   pre-existing available videos) and insert questions to create
   active-learning video experiences. Videos can be accessed by students on
   the Edpuzzle platform or directly from within most learning management
   systems. As students complete video assignments, instructors can access
   a variety of progress and performance metrics, use these metrics to
   identify weak points, and inform instruction. Edpuzzle also has unique
   student accountability features that allow instructors to choose to
   prevent students from skipping through videos or questions. Moreover,
   interactive questions can include chemical structures in the form of
   images or well-formatted equations or formulas, making Edpuzzle an
   attractive choice for optimizing video learning in and out of chemistry
   classrooms.},

Title = {Improving Learning Outcomes and Metacognitive Monitoring: Replacing

Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Number = {7},
Pages = {2156-2166},
Month = {JUL 13},
Abstract = {When students effectively engage with textbooks or videos prior to
   class, more active and collaborative learning activities can be
   incorporated into subsequent face-to-face learning. Such prelecture
   assignments are particularly important in flipped classrooms, where a
   portion of the content is delivered primarily before face-to-face
   instruction. While a large amount of research has addressed the need to
   improve active learning during lectures, little work has examined the
   need to improve out-of-class preparation. Most often, out-of-class
   preparation consists of videos or assigned textbook readings, but
   question-embedded videos have also been shown to be effective. When
   using question-embedded videos, students must pause the video and solve
   problems as they watch the video, transforming their passive video
   watching into an active learning experience. Here, we present the
   results of a randomized control trial study that compares learning
   behaviors and outcomes between students using content-equivalent
   resources: organic chemistry textbook readings or question-embedded
   videos. We found that students who used question-embedded videos for
   their preparation had significantly higher learning gains and
   metacognitive monitoring proficiencies than students who used textbook
   readings. These results indicate that question-embedded videos enforce
   more productive feedback-driven problem-solving behaviors than textbook
   readings, which leads to substantial gains in performance and
   metacognitive monitoring, better preparing students for in-class
   instruction.},

Title = {Self-supervised enhanced thyroid nodule detection in ultrasound
   examination video sequences with multi-perspective evaluation},
Journal = {PHYSICS IN MEDICINE AND BIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC 7},
Abstract = {Objective. Ultrasound is the most commonly used examination for the
   detection and identification of thyroid nodules. Since manual detection
   is time-consuming and subjective, attempts to introduce machine learning
   into this process are ongoing. However, the performance of these methods
   is limited by the low signal-to-noise ratio and tissue contrast of
   ultrasound images. To address these challenges, we extend thyroid nodule
   detection from image-based to video-based using the temporal context
   information in ultrasound videos. Approach. We propose a video-based
   deep learning model with adjacent frame perception (AFP) for accurate
   and real-time thyroid nodule detection. Compared to image-based methods,
   AFP can aggregate semantically similar contextual features in the video.
   Furthermore, considering the cost of medical image annotation for
   video-based models, a patch scale self-supervised model (PASS) is
   proposed. PASS is trained on unlabeled datasets to improve the
   performance of the AFP model without additional labelling costs. Main
   results. The PASS model is trained by 92 videos containing 23 773
   frames, of which 60 annotated videos containing 16 694 frames were used
   to train and evaluate the AFP model. The evaluation is performed from
   the video, frame, nodule, and localization perspectives. In the
   evaluation of the localization perspective, we used the average
   precision metric with the intersection-over-union threshold set to 50\%
   (AP@50), which is the area under the smoothed Precision-Recall curve.
   Our proposed AFP improved AP@50 from 0.256 to 0.390, while the
   PASS-enhanced AFP further improved the AP@50 to 0.425. AFP and PASS also
   improve the performance in the valuations of other perspectives based on
   the localization results. Significance. Our video-based model can
   mitigate the effects of low signal-to-noise ratio and tissue contrast in
   ultrasound images and enable the accurate detection of thyroid nodules
   in real-time. The evaluation from multiple perspectives of the ablation
   experiments demonstrates the effectiveness of our proposed AFP and PASS
   models.},

Title = {Empowering Young Adults With Significant Disabilities to Learn New
   Employment Skills Through Self-Directed Video-Based Instruction},
Journal = {CAREER DEVELOPMENT AND TRANSITION FOR EXCEPTIONAL INDIVIDUALS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 12},
Abstract = {Video-based instruction (VBI) is an effective means to teach employment
   skills to young adults with intellectual and developmental disabilities
   (IDD). Within the category of VBI, video prompting (VP) is well-suited
   to teach multistep routines, and video modeling (VM) is better suited
   for social interactions. In this multiple probe design, three young
   adults with IDD were taught to make badges with self-directed VP with
   error correction, and to request help for missing materials with VM.
   Functional relations were demonstrated between VP and progress on the
   badge-making skill, and VM and progress on requesting help. These
   findings demonstrate the utility of combining VP and VM to address both
   multistep routines and social skills in the workplace. We offer
   practical implications for how teachers and job coaches can leverage VBI
   to teach different kinds of employment skills to people with IDD.},

Title = {Examining situational interest and its relationship with self-efficacy
   in asynchronous and synchronous video lectures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {21},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {Recently, the number of online courses provided for university students
   around the world has increased substantially. Instruction is delivered
   most commonly through either asynchronous video lectures (pre-recorded
   videos with no real-time communication) or synchronous video lectures
   (live-streamed videos with real-time communication). From a learning
   perspective, it is important to capture the interest of learners based
   on specific situational aspects of both asynchronous and synchronous
   video lectures, and situational interest of learners may vary depending
   on the overall intrinsic qualities of each modality. Additionally, there
   may be variations in regards to the way in which self-efficacy interacts
   with situational interest depending on which modality is used. This
   study examines survey responses of university students (n = 93) in South
   Korea to determine if students perceive differences in situational
   interest between two different conditions: asynchronous video lectures
   and synchronous video lectures. Additionally, the difference between
   situational interest levels of learners with low self-efficacy and
   learners with high self-efficacy within each condition was examined. The
   main results showed no overall difference in situational interest
   between the two conditions and no difference in situational interest
   between learners with low self-efficacy and learners with high
   self-efficacy in the synchronous video lecture condition. However, there
   was a significant difference in situational interest found between
   learners with low self-efficacy and learners with high self-efficacy in
   the asynchronous video lecture condition. Results are explained through
   the differing effects of self-efficacy on situational interest based on
   the amount of autonomy provided in online learning environments.},

Title = {Evaluation of self-educational training methods to learn laparoscopic
   skills - a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {18},
Month = {MAY 2},
Abstract = {Background: Evaluation of two different self-educational methods (video
   assisted learning versus video assisted learning plus a nodal point
   operation primer) on learning laparoscopic suturing and intracorporal
   knotting.
   Methods: Randomized controlled trial at the laparoscopic surgical
   training center, University of Tubingen with 45 surgical novices first
   year medical students being pretested for dexterity. After
   self-educational training for 90 min with either method (Group A: video
   assisted learning, Group B: video assisted learning plus a nodal point
   operation primer) participants had to perform five laparoscopic
   intracorporal knots. Assessed were number of knots completed (maximum of
   five knots counted, knot integrity, technical proficiency and knotting
   time per knot. Primary outcome measure is a composed knot score
   combining knot integrity, technical proficiency and knotting time.
   Results: Group B (n = 23) achieved a significantly higher composed knot
   score than Group A (n = 22) (53.3 +/- 8.4 versus 46.5 +/- 13.6 points
   respectively, p = 0.016). Median knotting time per completed knot was
   significantly different between Group B and Group A (308 s {[}100-1221]
   versus 394 s {[}138-1397] respectively, p = 0.001). Concerning number of
   completed knots there was a trend towards more knots achieved in Group B
   (4.2 +/- 1.2 versus 3.55 +/- 1.4 respectively, p = 0.075).
   Conclusions: The use of a nodal point operation primer highlighting
   essential key steps of a procedure augment the success of learning
   laparoscopic skills as suturing and intracorporal knotting.},

Abstract = {Music is an integral part of video games and the cultures that surround
   them, and the sound of video games enhances the user's immersive
   game-play experience. Video game music (VGM) inspires performance and
   the creation of derivative music in both online and offline contexts.
   This study was conducted to explore how musicians perceived how helpful
   various learning strategies were for gaining the skills to publish VGM
   online. A cross-sectional, self-administered questionnaire was conducted
   at Super Music and Gaming Festival (TM) (Super MAGFest), an annual
   convention held near Washington DC, to capture data from respondents (n
   = 137) who were adult musicians who published VGM online. The
   questionnaire captured the perceived helpfulness of learning strategies
   at school, other educational institutions, and informal approaches.
   Descriptive and inferential statistics analyses were made. Respondents
   found music theory courses in school and informal music learning
   strategies were among the most helpful learning approaches for attaining
   the skills they needed to publish VGM online. This article provides a
   starting point for the further exploration of VGM and informal music
   learning in the age of the Internet.},

Abstract = {When analyzing classroom video, pre-service teachers can improve their
   professional vision, that is, their ability to notice important events
   in a classroom and to interpret them based on theoretical knowledge.
   However, learning with video is especially challenging for novice
   learners. Thus, video needs to be embedded into an instructional context
   to be effective. In an experimental study with 89 pre-service biology
   teachers, we investigated the effect of a short professional vision
   training and whether two design principles from multimedia learning
   research-namely segmenting and self-explanation prompts-could
   additionally increase training effects. In a one-hour training session
   on small-group tutoring strategies, participants watched practice video
   examples either as a whole or segmented. After each video or video
   segment, respectively, they received either open or focused
   self-explanation prompts to analyze the scene. We assessed participants'
   professional vision skills before and after training. Overall,
   participants' performance substantially increased from pretest to
   posttest. Moreover, during training, both segmented video examples and
   focused self-explanation prompts led to increased noticing of relevant
   strategies. This advantage during training, however, did not result in
   higher professional vision improvement in posttest scores compared to
   participants who worked in the less supported training phase conditions.
   We discuss possible explanations why additional support increased
   training performance but not learning gains and suggest an additional
   fading phase as a means to achieve persistent effects.},

Abstract = {During the past 15 years, the curriculum content for nonprescription
   medication and self-care therapeutics has expanded significantly.
   Self-care courses ranging from stand-alone, required courses to
   therapeutic content and skills laboratories, have evolved in colleges
   and schools of pharmacy to accommodate rapid changes related to
   nonprescription medications and to meet the needs of students. The
   design of and content delivery methods used in self-care courses vary
   among institutions. Teaching innovations such as team-based learning,
   role playing/vignettes, videos, and social media, as well as
   interdisciplinary learning have enhanced delivery of this content. Given
   that faculty members train future pharmacists, they should be familiar
   with the new paradigms of Nonprescription Safe Use Regulatory Expansion
   (NSURE) Initiative, nonprescription medications for chronic diseases,
   and the growing trends of health and wellness in advancing patient-care
   initiatives. This paper reviews the significant changes that may be

Abstract = {The opportunity to give oral presentations is important because it helps
   develop skills that are necessary for many aspects of professional
   careers. Competencies for oral presentations include appropriate
   content, design and organization of the presentation, and delivery
   skills. Self-assessment has been shown to help students develop
   meta-cognitive skills that can be used in all aspects of higher
   education, and it has been shown to improve student achievement in a
   range of different academic areas. In this study, students were recorded
   while giving two PowerPoint presentations on a topic of their choice.
   One section was required to complete a self-assessment rubric of their
   first presentation, while the other section was encouraged to watch
   themselves, but it was not required. All students also received
   instructor and peer evaluations. For their second presentations, the
   students who completed the self-assessment rubric received higher scores
   than the other group; significant differences were seen in content
   explanation, timing, and speech skills. Peer assessment scores
   correlated moderately well with the instructor scores, whereas the
   self-assessment scores did not. Despite the lack of congruence between
   self- and instructor scores, the combination of instructor, peer, and
   self-assessment resulted in consistently high-quality presentations. The
   students found the multiple types of feedback, use of video technology,
   and the opportunity to repeat their presentations useful.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to identify and evaluate the quality of videos
   for patients available on YouTube for learning to self-administer
   subcutaneous methotrexate. Using the search term ``Methotrexate
   injection,{''} two clinical reviewers analyzed the first 60 videos on
   YouTube. Source and search rank of video, audience interaction, video
   duration, and time since video was uploaded on YouTube were recorded.
   Videos were classified as useful, misleading, or a personal patient
   view. Videos were rated for reliability, comprehensiveness, and global
   quality scale (GQS). Reasons for misleading videos were documented, and
   patient videos were documented as being either positive or negative
   towards methotrexate (MTX) injection. Fifty-one English videos
   overlapped between the two geographic locations; 10 videos were
   classified as useful (19.6 \%), 14 misleading (27.5 \%), and 27 personal
   patient view (52.9 \%). Total views of videos were 161,028: 19.2 \%
   useful, 72.8 \% patient, and 8.0 \% misleading. Mean GQS: 4.2 (+/- 1.0)

Abstract = {Previous studies have shown that encouraging students to use
   self-explanation strategies has proven effective in text-focused
   learning contexts. However, no study to date has focused on how
   students' strategy preference moderates the effect of self-explanation
   strategies on learning from video lectures. The current study
   investigated how students' self-explanation strategy preference impacts
   their learning from video lectures by using prompts with a
   between-within-subjects design strategy preference (i.e., strategy
   preference vs. no strategy preference; between subject) and with prompt
   type ( i.e., focused vs. open; within-subject), assessing learning
   performance, cognitive load, attention allocation, quantity and quality
   of explanation, and behavioral patterns. Study results showed that,
   compared to students using open prompts and with no self-explanation
   preference, providing focused prompts improved their learning
   performance and explanation quality, lowering their cognitive load and
   enabling them to search for information more accurately. Meanwhile, for
   students with a self-explanation preference, the two types of prompts
   used in this study had a similar positive impact on their learning
   performance and their quality of explanation.},

Title = {Contrastive Self-Supervised Pre-Training for Video Quality Assessment},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {31},
Pages = {458-471},
Abstract = {Video quality assessment (VQA) task is an ongoing small sample learning
   problem due to the costly effort required for manual annotation. Since
   existing VQA datasets are of limited scale, prior research tries to
   leverage models pre-trained on ImageNet to mitigate this kind of
   shortage. Nonetheless, these well-trained models targeting on image
   classification task can be sub-optimal when applied on VQA data from a
   significantly different domain. In this paper, we make the first attempt
   to perform self-supervised pre-training for VQA task built upon
   contrastive learning method, targeting at exploiting the plentiful
   unlabeled video data to learn feature representation in a
   simple-yet-effective way. Specifically, we implement this idea by first
   generating distorted video samples with diverse distortion
   characteristics and visual contents based on the proposed distortion
   augmentation strategy. Afterwards, we conduct contrastive learning to
   capture quality-aware information by maximizing the agreement on feature
   representations of future frames and their corresponding predictions in
   the embedding space. In addition, we further introduce distortion
   prediction task as an additional learning objective to push the model
   towards discriminating different distortion categories of the input
   video. Solving these prediction tasks jointly with the contrastive
   learning not only provides stronger surrogate supervision signals, but
   also learns the shared knowledge among the prediction tasks. Extensive
   experiments demonstrate that our approach sets a new state-of-the-art in
   self-supervised learning for VQA task. Our results also underscore that
   the learned pre-trained model can significantly benefit the existing
   learning based VQA models. Source code is available at

Abstract = {Representation learning for video is increasingly gaining attention in
   the field of computer vision. For instance, video prediction models
   enable activity and scene forecasting or vision-based planning and
   control. In this article, we investigate the combination of
   differentiable physics and spatial transformers in a deep action
   conditional video representation network. By this combination our model
   learns a physically interpretable latent representation and can identify
   physical parameters. We propose supervised and self-supervised learning
   methods for our architecture. In experiments, we consider simulated
   scenarios with pushing, sliding and colliding objects, for which we also
   analyze the observability of the physical properties. We demonstrate
   that our network can learn to encode images and identify physical
   properties like mass and friction from videos and action sequences. We
   evaluate the accuracy of our training methods, and demonstrate the
   ability of our method to predict future video frames from input images
   and actions.},

Abstract = {The use of learning environments that apply Advanced Learning
   Technologies (ALTs) and Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is increasingly
   frequent. In this study, eye-tracking technology was used to analyze
   scan-path differences in a History of Art learning task. The study
   involved 36 participants (students versus university teachers with and
   without previous knowledge). The scan-paths were registered during the
   viewing of video based on SRL. Subsequently, the participants were asked
   to solve a crossword puzzle, and relevant vs. non-relevant Areas of
   Interest (AOI) were defined. Conventional statistical techniques
   (ANCOVA) and data mining techniques (string-edit methods and k-means
   clustering) were applied. The former only detected differences for the
   crossword puzzle. However, the latter, with the Uniform Distance model,
   detected the participants with the most effective scan-path. The use of
   this technique successfully predicted 64.9\% of the variance in learning
   results. The contribution of this study is to analyze the
   teaching-learning process with resources that allow a personalized
   response to each learner, understanding education as a right throughout

Abstract = {There is ample specialized literature on CV related issues (content,
   structure, format, steps in elaboration, modalities of correct
   elaboration, frequent types of errors). However, there are fewer studies
   regarding some specific ways of connecting the CV related issues with
   the new information and communication technologies and with their use in
   the promotion/self-promotion process on the labor market. For the
   digital natives, but not only for them, the situation of online
   application for a job, with the electronic transmission of the CV to the
   employer is already a widely spread practice. Recent studies include
   within the scope of current techniques theoretical analyses and concrete
   applications regarding CV updating, introducing the notion of video CV.
   There is the assumption that career counseling activities in the
   academic environment should extend their self-promotion methods by
   including video CVs, thus facilitating their knowledge and use by
   students. In this sense, within a project carried out in 2019 in our
   university, we aimed to facilitate the professional and social inclusion
   of prospective graduates by diversifying and modernizing the strategies
   of counseling and career guidance. The purpose of our study is the
   knowledge and comparative analysis (pre- and post-learning) of the
   students' perception about the video CV. Our research is of a
   quasi-experimental type, with an initial and final evaluation based on a
   questionnaire applied online. The research group consisted of 119
   students, of which 75 are part of the target group of the project. The
   quantitative analysis of the data obtained on the basis of the
   questionnaire was supplemented with the qualitative analysis of the-data
   obtained by using the focus-group method. The analysis and
   interpretation of the data collected by the two methods will allow both
   the students' perception of the degree of usefulness of the video CV as
   a tool for personal self-promotion and the extent to which it can be
   integrated and used at the level of the career counseling services.},

Title = {Using Synchronized Eye Movements to Predict Attention in Online Video
   Learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Concerns persist about attentional engagement in online learning. The
   inter-subject correlation of eye movements (ISC) has shown promise as an
   accessible and effective method for attention assessment in online
   learning. This study extends previous studies investigating ISC of eye
   movements in online learning by addressing two research questions.
   Firstly, can ISC predict students' attentional states at a finer level
   beyond a simple dichotomy of attention states (e.g., attending and
   distracted states)? Secondly, whether learners' learning styles affect
   ISC's prediction rate of attention assessment in video learning?
   Previous studies have shown that learners of different learning styles
   have different eye movement patterns when viewing static materials.
   However, limited research has explored the impact of learning styles on
   viewing patterns in video learning. An eye tracking experiment with
   participants watching lecture videos demonstrated a connection between
   ISC and self-reported attention states at a finer level. We also
   demonstrated that learning styles did not significantly affect ISC's
   prediction rate of attention assessment in video learning, suggesting
   that ISC of eye movements can be effectively used without considering
   learners' learning styles. These findings contribute to the ongoing
   discourse on optimizing attention assessment in the evolving landscape
   of online education.},

Abstract = {As technology becomes more accessible and acceptable in the preschool
   setting, teachers need effective strategies of incorporating it to
   address challenging behaviors. A nonconcurrent delayed multiple baseline
   design in combination with an alternating treatment design was utilized
   to investigate the effects of using iPad tablets to display video
   self-modeling and activity photos for three preschoolers during circle
   time. During baseline, all three children demonstrated low levels of
   engagement and high levels of off-task behavior compared to peers. The
   intervention phase consisted of alternating between showing the child
   the self-video and photos prior to circle time. A child preference phase
   was conducted whereby each child self-selected the video or photo prior
   to circle time. For all three children both videos and photos led to
   increased engagement and decreased off-task behaviors. During the child
   preference phase, all three children selected the video most frequently.
   Social validity data demonstrated teacher and child preference for the
   video self-modeling condition.},

Abstract = {We designed a video-based intervention to prepare preservice teachers to
   deal with classroom disruptions. Using tandem cases, we produced staged
   videos showing a functional scenario, in which a teacher deals
   effectively with disruptive behaviour, and a dysfunctional scenario, in
   which a teacher's behaviour leads to the escalation and spread of the
   disruption. We addressed two research questions. The first was whether
   video-based learning arrangements helped preservice teachers to develop
   three facets of professional vision: noticing critical incidents leading
   to disruptions, theoretical reflection on these incidents, and the
   development of appropriate strategies to deal with disruptions. The
   second was whether functional and dysfunctional video scenarios had
   different effects on knowledge acquisition, self-efficacy, noticing,
   reasoning, and the generation of strategies. We used a video test, a
   multiple-choice test, and a self-efficacy questionnaire to measure the
   effects in a pre-post design. Our findings show that both groups benefit
   from the video-based learning arrangements. Differential effects were
   only found for knowledge acquisition and (not significant) for
   reasoning.},

Abstract = {The use of hypermedia resources in the Learning Management System (LMS),
   such as computer graphics and virtual laboratories in which
   Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) is used, seem to increase students'
   motivation towards learning, as well as their satisfaction with the
   teaching-learning process. The possible causes appear to be that these
   resources in B-Learning environments increase the personalization of
   learning and respect for the rate of learning in each student. All this,
   makes the student increase the use of metacognitive strategies. Even
   though, hypermedia resources must be designed from an SRL structure.
   With this aim, we worked with a sample of 112 students that belong to
   the Health Sciences Degrees in third-grader. Eight computer graphics and
   two structured virtual laboratories, including videos and quizzes, with
   SRL were applied throughout a semester. Student satisfaction with the
   use of these resources and activities was analyzed. We applied, with the
   purpose to analyze the results, quantitative analysis techniques
   (descriptive statistics) with the SPSS v. 24 statistical package. Also,
   qualitative analysis (coding of open responses and category analysis) we
   used with the ATLAS.ti 8 software. The results show a remarkable degree
   of student satisfaction with the use of these resources (Mean = 4.37 out
   of 5). Moreover, in the analysis of the categorization of the answers to
   the open questions. Referring to the elimination of the categorization
   criteria with a higher frequency index: they were ``none{''}, ``adjusted
   didactic programming{''}, ``not working previous knowledge{''} that
   obtained the frequencies of 96, 38 and 31 respectively out of a total of
   206 categorized answers. Relating to the aspects to increase expanding
   the content, increasing the visual examples and videos with SRL were
   specified, because they obtain the frequencies of 40, 23 and 13
   respectively out of a total of 112. To sum it up, the use of computer
   graphics and virtual laboratories with SRL in B-Learning environments
   seems to be a very effective resource to increase the satisfaction and
   efficiency of the students. However, the results should be taken
   prudently due to the specificity of the sample and verified in future
   studies with students from other fields of knowledge.},

Title = {Detecting Mind-Wandering from Eye Movement and Oculomotor Data during
   Learning Video Lecture},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {3},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to detect mind-wandering experienced by
   pre-service teachers during a video learning lecture on physics. The
   lecture was videotaped and consisted of a live lecture in a classroom.
   The lecture was about Gauss's law on physics. We investigated whether
   oculomotor data and eye movements could be used as a marker to indicate
   the learner's mind-wandering. Each data was collected in a study in
   which 24 pre-service teachers (16 females and 8 males) reported
   mind-wandering experience through self-caught method while learning
   physics video lecture during 30 min. A Tobii Pro Spectrum (sampling
   rate: 300 Hz) was used to capture their eye-gaze during learning Gauss's
   law through a course video. After watching the video lecture, we
   interviewed pre-service teachers about their mind-wandering experience.
   We first used the self-caught method to capture the mind-wandering
   timing of pre-service teachers while learning from video lectures. We
   detected more accurate mind-wandering segments by comparing fixation
   duration and saccade count. We investigated two types of oculomotor data
   (blink count, pupil size) and nine eye movements (average peak velocity
   of saccades; maximum peak velocity of saccades; standard deviation of
   peak velocity of saccades; average amplitude of saccades; maximum
   amplitude of saccades; total amplitude of saccades; saccade count/s;
   fixation duration; fixation dispersion). The result was that the blink
   count could not be used as a marker for mind-wandering during learning
   video lectures among them (oculomotor data and eye movements), unlike
   previous literatures. Based on the results of this study, we identified
   elements that can be used as mind-wandering markers while learning from
   video lectures that are similar to real classes, among the oculomotor
   data and eye movement mentioned in previous literatures. Additionally,
   we found that most participants focused on past thoughts and felt
   unpleasant after experiencing mind-wandering through interview analysis.},

Abstract = {Emerging evidence has demonstrated that Virtual Reality (VR) supported
   lessons are able to enhance positive emotions and engagement as well as
   more memorable experiences, when compared to more traditional
   instructional tools such as readings from textbooks and videos. However,
   teachers' self-efficacy while teaching with VR technologies, VR safety
   in the classroom, the need for technical support and costs have been
   identified as potential obstacles for Pre-Service Teachers (PSTs) who
   are interested in the effective use of VR in the classroom. This study
   aims to explore how we may begin to address these obstacles by
   integrating VR supported lessons in Initial Teacher Education (ITE)
   courses. The originality of this study lies in the implementation of a
   short intervention in an already crowded Post graduate Diploma in
   Education (PGDE) curriculum and in analysing the impact on PSTs'
   self-confidence as a factor to initiate sustainable development.
   Participants were 198 PGDE Primary School student-teachers, who attended
   two-hour VRsupported sessions a week apart in February 2020. Findings
   suggest that engagement with VR lessons have encouraged participanting
   PSTs to explore this technology for their future practice across
   different subjects, impacting positively on their self-confidence.},

Volume = {45},

Abstract = {With the increasing complexity of the engineering role, today's
   graduates must be capable of confronting both technical and societal
   problems; underpinned by effective teamwork at their core. Problem-based
   learning has been implemented in engineering to better prepare students
   for modern industry. However, limited research has examined the complex
   social processes involved in PBL. The present study, therefore, reports
   on how students working in tutorless PBL groups - owing to teaching
   limitations - must effectively self-manage their team efforts if they
   are to succeed. This PBL arrangement involved a `floating facilitator'
   but the analysis focuses exclusively on the students' tutorless
   interactions. The data collected is from 22 chemical engineering
   undergraduates in four groups, and consists of naturalistic
   video-recordings of 32 PBL meetings (35 h). This corpus was examined
   empirically using conversation analysis to elucidate students' recurrent
   communicational practices. The microanalyses showed how students
   continuously established PBL as the collective responsibility of the
   group. Furthermore, students maintained `average', equal social
   identities, and used humour/self-deprecation in constructing an informal
   learning environment. In the absence of the tutor who would normally
   maintain cohesion, these strategies offer a means through which students
   adapt to the unfamiliarity of the tutorless setting, where no member is
   positioned as the substitute tutor.},

Title = {Students? feelings of social presence when creating learning-by-teaching
   educational videos for a potential audience},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {117},
Abstract = {Audience is emphasized in learning by teaching. This article focuses on
   44 sixth-grade students who cooperatively created video-tutorials in
   pairs. It analyzes: 1) self-reported perception of the audience; 2)
   personal references in the video-tutorials; 3) audience-based verbal
   actions throughout the creation process. First, self-reported perception
   is high, especially in video pro-duction. Second, 2.23\% of words are
   personal references, with differences between explanation (1.73\%) and
   questions (2.91\%). Third, script elaboration and video production
   gather most audience-based verbal actions (108 utterances): 76 come from
   the question part; 58 were task-based and 50 were content-based; 13
   indicate knowledge building. Two contributions are underlined: attention
   to the audience can fluctuate; inducing social presence can trigger
   elabo-ration, but it is often not materialized.},

Title = {Animating student engagement: The impacts of cartoon instructional
   videos on learning experience},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN LEARNING TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {27},
Abstract = {In the modern age of education, students increasingly demand engaging,
   customized multimedia content. Animation constitutes a powerful
   pedagogical tool by combining audio messages with tailored visual cues
   and graphics, to serve the dual functions of explaining complex concepts
   and engaging student interest in the learning process. This study
   explores the use of a series of animated videos to teach advanced
   accounting at an Australian university. Based on survey responses from
   254 undergraduate students over two semesters, we provide evidence of
   the specific avenues through which animated instructional videos enhance
   students' learning experience, including increased engagement and
   interest, improved understanding and greater flexibility in
   self-directed learning. Additionally, character design, voice acting and
   dialogues in animated videos are found vital to improving student
   engagement. Further, this study offers novel insights into how students
   from various demographic groups can derive different benefits from the
   animations. These findings deepen our existing understanding of the
   pedagogical advantages of animated instructional videos and offer
   valuable guidance to enable future educators to harness the power of
   animation technologies to produce effective teaching resources.},

Abstract = {Recognizing learners' motivational problems in online remote learning,
   this study examined the patterns of learner's academic emotions and
   facial expressions detected in asynchronous video-based learning. The
   research questions of this are: (1) What are the patterns between facial
   expressions and negative emotions (i.e., boredom, confusion, and
   frustration) that learners experienced during online video-based
   learning? (2) What are the learner's overall perceptions about their
   emotions during online video-based learning? This study was conducted
   with 26 Korean adult learners who took an online video lecture via an
   asynchronous self-directed mode. Their facial expressions during online
   learning were recorded and analyzed for detecting affective states. Two
   judges trained in Ekman's Facial Action Coding System (FACS) analyzed
   210 scenes segmented from the recorded video data using a retrospective
   affect judgment procedure. The analysis identified 101 incidences of
   boredom, 82 confusions, and 62 frustrations. Moreover, using Spearman's
   rank correlation coefficients and hierarchical clustering, we identified
   some patterns of significant relationships between facial action units
   and affective states. The interview data reveal that the potential
   reasons for negative emotions include lack of concentration,
   uninteresting content, and one-way content delivery method. Given the
   massive transition to online video-based learning during and after
   COVID-19, the results of this study can provide implications concerning
   how to detect and intervene in potential issues associated with
   learner's motivation and affective states.},

Abstract = {It is essential for educators to be able to accurately assess students
   according to their problem-solving competencies. However, traditional
   assessment tools, often measure superficial skills and are not valid for
   assessing the context in which the knowledge and skills are applied
   (Shute et al., 2016). It has been shown that computer games could help
   educators determine not only students' current levels of
   problem-solving, but also students' strengths and weaknesses in a
   particular phase of problem-solving (Shute et al., 2016). Gamification
   is the use of game thinking and game procedure to engage the audience
   and solve problems (Zichermann, 2010). Building on this idea, the aim of
   this investigation is to create a video-game (based on gamification)
   that can be used to assess the students' performance competence in
   chemical problem-solving. To this end, we designed a game based on the
   four scales problem-solving model with three levels of proficiency
   (Koppelt \& Tiemann, 2008). In a qualitative pre-study, think-aloud
   transcript and interview were applied with two 9th-grade students who
   played the game for 60 minutes. Based on the outcomes of the qualitative
   study, for the main study, two videos for each problem-solving
   proficiency level, a pre-post questionnaire, and think-aloud transcript
   will be prepared for validation of the game by an expert rating. The
   future finding of this study could be used to improve the validity of
   this assessment tool based on gamification to assess the problem-solving
   proficiency levels in chemistry education.},

Abstract = {The management of self-directed learning is especially critical for
   massive open online course (MOOC) learners. This mixed-method study
   investigated MOOC instructors' strategies to facilitate learners'
   self-management skills for SDL. The study used three data sources: (a)
   an online survey with 198 MOOC instructors; (b) semi-structured
   interviews with 22 participants (the primary data source); and (c)
   document reviews of 22 MOOCs. The quantitative data were analyzed using
   descriptive statistics, and the qualitative data were analyzed using
   content analysis. The study findings indicate that MOOC instructors
   facilitated learners' self-management skills from four perspectives: the
   enactment of learning goals (e.g., explanations and appreciation of
   students' learning goals); time management (e.g., providing time frames,
   progress indicators, and short learning units); management of resources
   and support (e.g., flexible learning resources, peer assessments, and
   accessibilities); and navigation (e.g., clear organization and video
   tutorials on navigating the MOOC). The paper discusses the implications
   for researchers and practitioners.},

Journal = {SENSORS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Panoramic videos are shot by an omnidirectional camera or a collection
   of cameras, and can display a view in every direction. They can provide
   viewers with an immersive feeling. The study of super-resolution of
   panoramic videos has attracted much attention, and many methods have
   been proposed, especially deep learning-based methods. However, due to
   complex architectures of all the methods, they always result in a large
   number of hyperparameters. To address this issue, we propose the first
   lightweight super-resolution method with self-calibrated convolution for
   panoramic videos. A new deformable convolution module is designed first,
   with self-calibration convolution, which can learn more accurate offset
   and enhance feature alignment. Moreover, we present a new residual dense
   block for feature reconstruction, which can significantly reduce the
   parameters while maintaining performance. The performance of the
   proposed method is compared to those of the state-of-the-art methods,
   and is verified on the MiG panoramic video dataset.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE AND LITERACY EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Video self-analysis is a useful tool for teacher education, and while
   teacher educators often espouse the benefits of its use, the
   perspectives of preservice teachers who have used this tool have rarely
   been taken into consideration. Their perspectives can help teacher
   educators understand what makes video self-analysis tasks more
   meaningful, authentic, and engaging for preservice teachers. In this
   study, two graduate student researchers interviewed former preservice
   teachers who were recent graduates of an initial teacher certification
   program about their perceptions of video analysis use in the program.
   The guiding question for the study was, In what ways did video analysis
   provide impactful learning experiences for these preservice teachers?
   The researchers had worked as university supervisors and course
   instructors with the preservice teachers in the study. Four participants
   reflected in hour-long, semi-structured interviews on the effects of
   using video self-analysis. Results from qualitative coding analysis
   indicated the benefits of seeing other classroom contexts, leveraging
   multiple, converging voices for reflection, and curating intentional
   video footage through planning. Possible implications for instructional
   design include planning for scaffolded video analysis tasks and
   cultivating video-based reflection in and for practice.},

Abstract = {Background: The COVID-19 pandemic required pharmacy educators to seek
   creative and innovative ways of delivering learning outcomes in the
   virtual environment. Objective Structured Clinical Examinations (OSCEs)
   have been particularly challenging to deliver online. Objective: To
   explore the use of asynchronous video interview software as a platform
   for virtual OSCEs in pharmacy education, and for conducting brief
   structured research interviews. Method: Fourth year Bachelor of Pharmacy
   students at an Australian university, were interviewed via asynchronous
   video interview software (Big Interview) about their perceptions of
   using the platform for virtual OSCEs. Results: 37 students (92.5\%) used
   Big Interview to complete at least one summative OSCE case during a
   team-based simulation. Seven research interviews were recorded by six
   students. Positive comments focussed on facilitation of self-reflection
   and self-correction in patient questioning and counselling. Negative
   views concerned the lack of authenticity, including the robotic and
   artificial nature of interactions. Conclusion: Asynchronous video
   interview software for pharmacy OSCEs may assist formative learning and
   self-reflection, offering an adjunct to, but not replacement of,
   in-person communication.},

Abstract = {Information and communication technologies (ICT) have experienced a
   sharp growth in the recent twenty years. Currently, the students have
   almost unlimited access to the modern technologies and they use them on
   everyday basis. They are familiarised with them much more than the older
   generation. The youth produces a large quantity of digital content, as
   for example various audio and video files, emails, SMS, blogs etc. This
   presents a great challenge for the educators -to educate themselves in
   usage of these technologies and to adapt the process of education itself
   to these technologies.
   Despite the fact that m-learning is generally viewed as one of possible
   ways of e-learning development, it does not mean only moving of the
   e-learning to mobile devices but it is also necessary to include other
   approaches to education. There are many foreign researchers who see a
   great potential in inclusion of mobile technologies. Similarly, to the
   e-learning, where blended learning seems to be the most efficient way of
   implementation, it is suitable to apply m-learning together with the
   traditional methods of teaching which may be enriched by a new and still
   unused dimension of mobile education. After quite a long time, we have a
   technology, which is accessible to a large number of the public without
   significant financial limits. Currently, mobile devices are being used
   by the majority of the population of the developed countries. In the
   recent years, there have been developed many useful educational
   applications for mobile devices, including both educational platforms
   and educational methods. Thus, the differences are also among the
   individual levels of education (ISCED classification).
   This paper aims to map the approaches to usage of the mobile devices in
   university environment in the Czech Republic, especially as the tools
   for accessing the educational content and their potential usage in
   direct teaching and controlled self-studying.},

Abstract = {Little is known about the strategies elementary school students use to
   self-regulate their learning while in a hypermedia environment. This
   exploratory study investigated the self-regulatory strategies that young
   students (N = 48, M-age = 10.75) utilized while individually completing
   a 20-min online research task about space. Video data was coded using
   Azevedo et al.'s (2004) established coding scheme for analyzing
   self-regulatory behavior in hypermedia environments. Results showed that
   young students spent the majority of their time using cognitive
   strategies (M = 75.26\%) to read and summarise information to complete
   the task. Little time was taken to plan (M = 6.99\%) or monitor (M =
   5.92\%) their work or learning processes, which are key attributes of
   effective self-regulation. The study reveals the disparity between the
   ability to navigate within a hypermedia environment and utilizing
   planning and monitoring processes to enhance learning while using
   digital tools. This study highlights the need for the explicit teaching
   of planning and monitoring strategies in order for young students to
   develop the full range of self-regulation skills they need when using
   technology, for instance while learning from home during COVID-19.
   Implications for curriculum policy and teacher practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of interactive
   learning materials on learners' self-regulated learning processes and
   learning satisfaction. A two-group experimental design was employed for
   285 primary school teachers involved in teacher training. Teachers in
   the experimental group utilised interactive learning materials along
   with training videos and guidelines for their self-development at the
   school level. Teachers in the control group conducted self-development
   only with training videos and guidelines. The result was analysed using
   self-regulated learning theory explaining how one's self-regulation
   processes affect learning satisfaction. Five self-regulation processes
   were identified in this study: internal motivation, motivation for
   better assessment, planning and organizing skills, critical and positive
   thinking skills, and effort regulation. The analysis was conducted in
   two steps. First, t-test analysis was used to identify the significant
   differences between the experimental group and the control group. The
   analysis revealed: (1) teachers conducting self-development with
   interactive learning materials were highly motivated to achieve better
   teacher assessment, (2) teachers with interactive learning materials had
   higher learning satisfaction. Second, the study further investigated the
   effect of interactive materials on the relationship between
   self-regulation processes and learning satisfaction, using moderation
   analysis. The results showed that interactive materials significantly
   affect the relationship between motivation for better assessment and
   learning satisfaction, as well as the relationship between internal
   motivation and learning satisfaction. These results were complemented by
   qualitative analysis including interviews and focus group discussions
   with teachers.},

Abstract = {Oral demonstration of knowledge is an effective learning and assessment
   strategy. It has been shown that generating explanations to oneself, or
   self-explaining, can improve student understanding of information. This
   can be achieved via student -generated videos. The quantitative effects
   of student-generated videos on learning and assessment in postsecondary
   education are unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
   analyze the effects asynchronous student-generated videos have on
   student learning and assessment in a large-enrollment (-400 students),
   undergraduate physiology course. Students were charged with making
   self-generated videos discussing major physiological concepts and
   uploading these videos to Flip for assessment. Flip is an online, social
   education platform for asynchronous video-based discussion. In the
   present study, we combined four semesters (n = 1,100 students) of Flip
   data and analyzed the effects it had on student examination performance.
   Specifically, we first analyzed how students performed on exam questions
   corresponding to their Flip prompts in comparison to students not
   assigned those prompts {[}25/44 (57\%) were statistically significantly
   different]. Second, we analyzed the association between Flip prompt
   score and performance on corresponding exam questions {[}39/44 (89\%)
   were statistically significantly different]. Third, we analyzed the
   association between cumulative Flip score and performance on all
   corresponding, and noncorresponding exam questions. Finally, we analyzed
   the association between cumulative Flip score and averaged exam
   performance. There was a positive association (r = 0.54). Taken
   together, our data suggest that asynchronous student-generated Flip
   videos can facilitate student learning and assessment in a
   large-enrollment, undergraduate physiology course.},

Title = {Fostering Generative Learning From Video Lessons: Benefits of

Abstract = {This study explored ways to foster generative learning during a narrated
   video lesson about the human kidney. In a 2 x 3 between-subjects design,
   196 college students were randomly assigned to a video format condition
   and a learning strategy condition. Students listened to oral
   explanations from the instructor as they viewed either a series of
   static diagrams (static visuals) or the same diagrams dynamically drawn
   on the screen without the instructor visible (instructor-generated
   visuals). After each part of the lesson, students either wrote verbal
   explanations (explain) or created drawings (draw), or they rewatched
   that part of the lesson (rewatch). All students then completed retention
   and transfer tests on the material. Results indicated a significant main
   effect of learning strategy for retention and transfer: the explain
   group significantly outperformed the draw group (retention: d =.60;
   transfer: d =.67) and the rewatch group (retention: d =.58; transfer d
   =.87). There was also a significant video format by learning strategy
   interaction for transfer: explaining was most effective for students who
   observed instructor-generated visuals (ds > 1.0) rather than static
   visuals (ds <.5). These findings suggest that when learning from
   narrated video lessons with complex diagrams, students benefit most from
   viewing dynamically generated drawings and then verbally explaining what
   they learned. In contrast, creating drawings may not be appropriate for
   learning from diagram-heavy lessons. Overall, this study demonstrates
   the importance of aligning instructional methods with appropriate
   learning strategies.},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has had an enormous and unprecedented effect on
   higher education. Perhaps most notably, the virus catalysed a speedy
   movement to online delivery in response to the range of mandatory
   physical restrictions to campuses and classrooms around the world. To
   that end, this article discusses the online self-access student support
   options that were implemented at a mid-size public Australian university
   during March and April 2020. Drawing upon reflections from three student
   support leaders at the institution, it explores the rapid development
   and deployment of three new initiatives: self-access resources and
   videos for preparing to learn online, videoconference appointment
   options with learning advisers and librarians, and peer-to-peer virtual
   guides to online learning. It also comments on the implications of these
   programs for future practice, including the personally observed
   criticality of student feedback on accessible short video guides,
   flexible online individual support options and avenues for connecting
   with peers for technical support. Through this exploration and
   reflection, this article contributes to the new emerging body of
   literature on student support during the outbreak of COVID-19.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Self-care skills are generally learned from one's family
   in a natural environment such as the home. This study aims to examine
   the effectiveness of the teaching skills of a mother on her child's
   acquisition of self care skills.
   Method: The study was conducted with an 18-year-old individual with
   intellectual disability (ID) and her 42-year old mother. The study
   employed multiple probe design, one of the single-subject research
   models. The independent variable of the study was the family education
   program entitled ``Self Care Instruction to Individuals with ID{''}.
   These were the teaching activities carried out by the mother with her
   child with ID in line with this program. The dependent variable was the
   level of the individual with ID to fulfill the targeted self-care
   skills.
   Findings: The findings revealed that (a) the instruction given by the
   mother who completed the family education program on teaching self-care
   was effective in her child's acquisition of self-care skills, (b) the
   child was able to generalize the skills acquired to other environments,
   different individuals and different materials, and (c) the child was
   able to perform the skills well following the program.
   Discussion: Research findings demonstrate that using videos to model
   instruction on self-care skills is both effective and scientifically
   based. By the end of the program, the child's performance in all of the
   self-care skills showed improvement, which meant that the results
   supported those of previous studies.},

Abstract = {Studies shows that an individual's personality plays a major role in the
   educational process, and directly determines a student's predisposition
   to engage in a self-directed learning process. This is particularly the
   case with distance education, where motivation is a key factor. With the
   newly emerging field of interactive video in education, personality
   traits can be determined by various approaches. Filling out a
   personality form might be an unattractive method of profiling students.
   But with the case of interactive video, requiring by definition a
   voluntary user interaction, this information can be obtained by aligning
   interaction patterns to personality traits, adapting established
   psychological classification models. A key advantage is the
   non-intrusiveness of the process.},

   levels of physical education teacher education (PETE) students in the
   Philippines who are attending a flexible learning setup (i.e.,
   synchronous and asynchronous learning) offered by their university as a
   solution to continue classes during the coronavirus disease (COVID)-19
   pandemic. Utilizing a cross-sectional comparative research design, the
   study indicates that PETE students were very tired and exhausted both in
   general and visually after a series of video conferencing within a
   semester. Furthermore, they were socially-, motivationally-, and
   emotionally- moderately tired and exhausted. It was observed that
   students in the PETE program experienced moderate to very tired and
   exhausted levels of fatigue whenever they participated in synchronous
   online classes, such as attendance at a video teleconferencing platform.
   Exploration of how specific mental aspects relate to their general

Abstract = {Purpose The society faces growing global challenges in terms of
   sustainable development. A key factor in preparing society for these
   challenges is education for sustainable development (ESD). This study
   aims to discuss how the combination of research-based learning (RBL) and
   digitalization can be used for successful ESD in higher education. The
   paper introduces the conceptual development of technical and didactical
   implications for an online learning format, which combines the
   opportunities of RBL and digitalization to facilitate the distribution
   of ESD. Furthermore, corresponding evaluation results are presented.
   Design/methodology/approach A framework, based on key dimensions
   described by the relevant literature, was applied for the empirical
   approach to evaluate students' learning experiences. On this basis, the
   differences in the students' learning experiences between the RBL-format
   and conventional digital learning format (self-directed studies,
   learning videos and electronic examination) were measured. Findings The
   performed two-sample t-test indicates statistical significant
   differences in all dimensions. On average, students (N = 226) using the
   RBL-based format report higher ratings for each examined dimension than
   students who experienced a conventional format. In summary, this
   indicates an overall corresponding tendency in students' learning
   experience between the examined learning formats. Originality/value The
   presented examination offers empirically based insights on how a digital
   format can combine RBL and ESD to enhance students' learning
   experiences. Moreover, theoretical contributions are provided regarding
   the future development of digital learning formats to further integrate
   ESD in higher education.},

Abstract = {Video description refers to understanding visual content and
   transforming that acquired understanding into automatic textual
   narration. It bridges the key AI fields of computer vision and natural
   language processing in conjunction with real-time and practical
   applications. Deep learning-based approaches employed for video
   description have demonstrated enhanced results compared to conventional
   approaches. The current literature lacks a thorough interpretation of
   the recently developed and employed sequence to sequence techniques for
   video description. This paper fills that gap by focusing mainly on deep
   learning-enabled approaches to automatic caption generation. Sequence to
   sequence models follow an Encoder-Decoder architecture employing a
   specific composition of CNN, RNN, or the variants LSTM or GRU as an
   encoder and decoder block. This standard-architecture can be fused with
   an attention mechanism to focus on a specific distinctiveness, achieving
   high quality results. Reinforcement learning employed within the
   Encoder-Decoder structure can progressively deliver state-of-the-art
   captions by following exploration and exploitation strategies. The
   transformer mechanism is a modern and efficient transductive
   architecture for robust output. Free from recurrence, and solely based
   on self-attention, it allows parallelization along with training on a
   massive amount of data. It can fully utilize the available GPUs for most
   NLP tasks. Recently, with the emergence of several versions of
   transformers, long term dependency handling is not an issue anymore for
   researchers engaged in video processing for summarization and
   description, or for autonomous-vehicle, surveillance, and instructional
   purposes. They can get auspicious directions from this research.},

Abstract = {The ability to learn in a self-regulated way is important for
   adolescents' academic achievements. Monitoring one's own learning is a
   prerequisite skill for successful self-regulated learning. However,
   accurate monitoring has been found to be difficult for adolescents,
   especially for learning problem-solving tasks such as can be found in
   math and biology. This study investigated whether a self-explaining
   strategy, which has been found effective for improving monitoring
   accuracy in learning from text, can improve monitoring and
   regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance in
   secondary biology education. In 2 experiments, one half of the
   participants learned to solve biology problems by studying
   video-modeling examples, and the other one half learned by giving
   step-by-step self-explanations following the video-modeling examples
   (Experiment 1) or by following the posttest problem-solving tasks
   (Experiment 2). Results showed that in contrast to earlier studies,
   self-explaining did not improve monitoring and regulation-choice
   effectiveness. However, the quality of self-explanations was found to be
   related to monitoring accuracy and performance. Interestingly, the
   complexity of the problem-solving tasks affected monitoring and
   regulation-choice effectiveness, and problem-solving performance. These
   results are discussed in relation to the cognitive demands that
   monitoring and regulating learning to solve problems combined with
   self-explaining pose on learners.},

Title = {Immediate Versus Delayed Low-Stakes Questioning: Encouraging the Testing
   Effect Through Embedded Video Questions to Support Students' Knowledge
   Outcomes, Self-Regulation, and Critical Thinking},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {In light of the educational challenges brought about by the COVID-19
   pandemic, there is a growing need to bolster online science teaching and
   learning by incorporating evidence-based pedagogical principles of
   Learning Experience Design (LXD). As a response to this, we conducted a
   quasi-experimental, design-based research study involving nN = 183
   undergraduate students enrolled across two online classes in an
   upper-division course on Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at a large R1
   public university. The study extended over a period of 10 weeks, during
   which half of the students encountered low-stakes questions immediately
   embedded within the video player, while the remaining half received the
   same low-stakes questions after viewing all the instructional videos
   within the unit. Consequently, this study experimentally manipulated the
   timing of the questions across the two class conditions. These questions
   functioned as opportunities for low-stakes content practice and
   retention, designed to encourage learners to experience testing effect
   and augment the formation of their conceptual understanding. Across both
   conditions, we assessed potential differences in total weekly quiz
   grades, page views, and course participation among students who
   encountered embedded video questions. We also assessed students'
   self-report engagement, self-regulation, and critical thinking. On
   average, the outcomes indicated that learners exposed to immediate
   low-stakes questioning exhibited notably superior summative quiz scores,
   increased page views, and enhanced participation in the course.
   Additionally, those who experienced immediate questioning demonstrated
   heightened levels of online engagement, self-regulation, and critical
   thinking. Moreover, our analysis delved into the intricate interplay
   between treatment conditions, learners' self-regulation, critical
   thinking, and quiz grades through a multiple regression model. Notably,
   the interaction between those in the immediate questioning condition and
   self-regulation emerged as a significant factor, suggesting that the
   influence of immediate questioning on quiz grades varies based on
   learners' self-regulation abilities. Collectively, these findings
   highlight the substantial positive effects of immediate questioning of
   online video lectures on both academic performance and cognitive skills
   within an online learning context. This discussion delves into the

Title = {Spatiotemporal module for video saliency prediction based on
   self-attention},
Journal = {IMAGE AND VISION COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {112},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Considering that the existing video saliency prediction methods still
   have limitations in spatiotemporal correla-tion learning between
   features and saliency regions, this paper proposes a spatiotemporal
   module for video sa-liency prediction based on self-attention. The
   proposed model emphasizes three essential problems as follows. First, we
   raise a multi-scale feature-fusion network (MFN) for effective feature
   integration. The framework can extract and fuse features from four
   scales at low memory cost. Second, we view the task as a global
   evaluation of the correlation on pixel level to predict human visual
   attention in task-driven scenes more accurately. An adapted transformer
   encoder is designed for spatiotemporal correlation learning. Finally, we
   introduce DConvLSTM to learn the context in videos. Experimental results
   show that the proposed model achieves state -of-the-art performance on
   both driving scenes and natural scenes with multi-motion information.
   And our model also achieves very comparable performance especially in
   natural scenes with multi-category objects. It proves our method is
   practicable in both data-driven and task-driven conditions. (c) 2021

Title = {Student perceptions of a video-based blended learning approach for
   improving pediatric physical examination skills},
Journal = {ANNALS OF ANATOMY-ANATOMISCHER ANZEIGER},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {208},
Pages = {179-182},
Abstract = {Aim: Physical examination skills are crucial for a medical doctor. The
   physical examination of children differs significantly from that of
   adults. Students often have only limited contact with pediatric patients
   to practice these skills. In order to improve the acquisition of
   pediatric physical examination skills during bedside teaching, we have
   developed a combined video-based training concept, subsequently
   evaluating its use and perception.
   Methods: Fifteen videos were compiled, demonstrating defined physical
   examination sequences in children of different ages. Students were
   encouraged to use these videos as preparation for bedside teaching
   during their pediatric clerkship. After bedside teaching, acceptance of
   this approach was evaluated using a 10-item survey, asking for the
   frequency of video use and the benefits to learning, self-confidence,
   and preparation of bedside teaching as well as the concluding OSCE.
   Results: N=175 out of 299 students returned survey forms (58.5\%).
   Students most frequently used videos, either illustrating complete
   examination sequences or corresponding focus examinations frequently
   assessed in the OSCE. Students perceived the videos as a helpful method
   of conveying the practical process and preparation for bedside teaching
   as well as the OSCE, and altogether considered them a worthwhile
   learning experience. Self-confidence at bedside teaching was enhanced by
   preparation with the videos. The demonstration of a defined standardized
   procedural sequence, explanatory comments, and demonstration of
   infrequent procedures and findings were perceived as particularly
   supportive. Long video segments, poor alignment with other curricular
   learning activities, and technical problems were perceived as less
   helpful. Students prefer an optional individual use of the videos, with
   easy technical access, thoughtful combination with the bedside teaching,
   and consecutive standardized practice of demonstrated procedures.
   Conclusions: Preparation with instructional videos combined with bedside
   teaching, were perceived to improve the acquisition of pediatric
   physical examination skills. (C) 2016 Elsevier GmbH. All rights

Title = {Dynamic self-attention with vision synchronization networks for video
   question answering},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {132},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Video Question Answering (VideoQA) has gained increasing attention as an
   important task in understanding the rich spatio-temporal contents, i.e.,
   the appearance and motion in the video. However, existing approaches
   mainly use the question to learn attentions over all the sampled
   appearance and motion features separately, which neglect two properties
   of VideoQA: (1) the answer to the question is often reflected on a few
   frames and video clips, and most video contents are superfluous; (2)
   appearance and motion features are usually concomitant and complementary
   to each other in time series. In this paper, we propose a novel VideoQA
   model, i.e., Dynamic Self-Attention with Vision Synchronization Networks
   (DSAVS), to address these problems. Specifically, a gated token
   selection mechanism is proposed to dynamically select the important
   tokens from appearance and motion sequences. These chosen tokens are fed
   into a self-attention mechanism to model the internal dependencies for
   more effective representation learning. To capture the correlation
   between the appearance and motion features, a vision synchronization
   block is proposed to synchronize the two types of vision features at the
   time slice level. Then, the visual objects can be correlated with their
   corresponding activities and the performance is further improved.
   Extensive experiments conducted on three public VideoQA data sets
   confirm the effectivity and superiority of our model compared with
   state-of-the-art methods.(c) 2022 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Facilitating nursing students' skill training in distance education via
   online game-based learning with the watch-summarize-question approach
   during the COVID-19 pandemic: A quasi-experimental study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {109},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Key challenges for clinical education during the COVID-19
   pandemic include how to continue teaching and learning, how to teach
   core clinical skills, and how to demonstrate professional and practical
   skills in various clinical situations. Therefore, nursing students need
   to learn how to assist with in-patient intubation, eliminate accumulated
   sputum overflow, and the basic techniques of sputum suction.
   Objectives: We proposed and investigated an approach to integrating
   online game-based learning with the watchsummarize-question strategy to
   improve nursing students' learning achievement, self-efficacy, learning
   engagement, and learning satisfaction in sputum suction skill training.
   Design: A quasi-experimental study with pretest and posttest design.
   Settings and participants: We randomly allocated 45 first-year nursing
   students to an experimental group (n = 21) or a control group (n = 24)
   at a school of nursing in a university.
   Methods: The experimental group adopted the online game-based learning
   and watch-summarize-question strategy, while the control group used
   video-based learning. Participants were assessed on learning achievement
   of sputum suction skills, self-efficacy, learning engagement, and
   learning satisfaction before and after the intervention.
   Results: The experimental group, which used the proposed approach,
   achieved statistically significant higher learning achievement,
   self-efficacy, learning engagement, and learning satisfaction than the
   control group.
   Conclusions: The integration of online game-based learning with the
   watch-summarize-question strategy demonstrated a positive impact on
   nursing students' sputum suction skill training. Nurse educators and
   researchers should consider integrating computer technology and teaching
   strategies to facilitate nursing education.},

Abstract = {This qualitative study uses grounded theory to derive a set of

   demonstrated social-emotional skills in video game play. We found
   evidence of social-emotional learning concepts through analysing game

Abstract = {This Full Paper in the Innovative Practice track describes a new
   approach towards online agile teamwork in a higher education context.
   The presented learning format is based on the agile epic bedtime story
   game and the concept of self-organized learning. It focuses on
   time-constrained teamwork, with the aim to achieve a shared result from
   the work of several loosely connected teams through iterative learning
   and feedback loops within and across teams. We previously successfully
   applied and evaluated this team collaboration format in onsite learning.
   In this online adaptation, the efficiency of this approach is
   complemented with team-building exercises, to somewhat compensate for
   the lack of social interaction that is inherent to online communication.
   This approach combines the idea of agile gamification in education with
   previous concepts of self-organized learning (S-O-L) and the
   container-differences-exchange (CDE) model to organize
   self-organization. The infrastructure prerequisites for this format are
   moderate: a tool for video conferencing, a digital whiteboard and a
   digital collaborative writing tool. The online learning format was
   implemented and evaluated in an undergraduate University course on
   Informatics and Society in autumn 2020 with 36 participating students.
   We conducted a summative qualitative content analysis of student reports
   to examine the effect this format has both on the learning experience as
   well as the social interaction between participants. Self-organized
   teamwork appeared viable for learning: Students rated the question how
   well it enabled them to learn the content of the course with a median of
   8 on a scale from 1 (worst) to 10 (best) and a standard deviation of
   1.5. Students considered iterative work in the same team productive,
   while communication across teams was perceived challenging. Teams
   established continuity in their communication, also between sessions,
   through freely available communication tools. The single most important
   factor to help social interaction mentioned by students was the use of
   breakout rooms.},

Abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (IVR) technology influences students'
   cognitive processes and affective experience, according to previous
   research findings. Yet, empirical studies that investigate the impact of
   IVR on science education in secondary schools are limited. This article
   reports a pilot study that has two objectives: First, to investigate
   whether learning science with IVR leads to more positive learning
   outcomes than that with a traditional video-viewing activity; and
   second, to investigate whether corrective feedback produces more
   positive learning outcomes than explanatory feedback in IVR-mediated
   contexts. A randomized, controlled pilot trial was designed during a
   school year at a secondary school in western China. Forty-seven
   participatory students were randomly assigned to a control group
   (learning with instructional videos, n = 17), an intervention group 1
   (learning with IVR with corrective feedback, n = 15), and an
   intervention group 2 (learning with IVR with explanatory feedback, n =
   15). We evaluated an array of student learning-related outcomes,
   including extraneous and germane cognitive loads, intrinsic learning
   motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and academic
   achievement. The results revealed a significant difference in intrinsic
   learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, learner satisfaction, and
   academic achievement, but an insignificant difference in extraneous and
   germane cognitive loads when students learned with video and IVR. In
   terms of the type of feedback provided in IVR-mediated environments,
   students who were prompted with corrective feedback and explanatory
   feedback showed little difference in their learning outcomes. The
   reasons related to the findings and limitations are discussed.},

Abstract = {Research has indicated that co-creative educational processes in
   entrepreneurship education (EE) foster the development of both
   entrepreneurial skills and skills needed in the studies as well as a
   broadened perspective among the students in general. We state that to
   succeed with this the self-reflectiveness is a necessary component. The
   purpose of this paper is therefore to consider EE and
   self-reflectiveness from the student perspective. We look at
   self-reflectiveness in action. More specifically we study how
   self-assessment through a reflective task using video clips can trigger
   and activate entrepreneurial thinking and learning about
   entrepreneurship and intrapreneurship among BA students in Denmark and
   Finland. The preliminary findings show that video-clips seem to be a
   successful way to reveal and trigger reflectiveness among the students.
   Furthermore, the reflections seem to trigger deeper insights as well as
   learning and reflection upon and about the entrepreneurial mindset and
   skills related to the entrepreneurship in a somewhat transformational
   way. The findings are beneficial for developing EE and for gaining
   insight into how the students think about entrepreneurship, related
   skills and becoming entrepreneurs. The video-clip as an examination
   seems also to be beneficial when both learning about and assessing
   entrepreneurial thinking.},

Abstract = {The self-regulated learning (SRL) emphasizes an autonomy and a control
   over student's learning and as such, SRL depends on the metacognitive
   abilities of the learner. Metacognitive knowledge allows choosing a
   proper strategy In order to reach a learning goal of the student.
   Metacognitive regulation Is Important for the Implementation of this
   strategy and metacognitive monitoring Is Important to evaluation whether
   the chosen strategy was appropriate or should be replaced. In our
   research we examine an Improvement of accuracy of the metacognitive
   monitoring In the classroom during onscreen self-regulated learning.
   Thirty undergraduate students In counselling had to study target
   psychological concepts (such as operant conditioning, observational
   learning, conformity, Identification, etc.) In three separate phases
   related to SRL (preparatory, performance and appraisal phase) each week
   during seven weeks In the semester. In the preparatory phase, students
   received a target concept and In accordance with this concept, they set
   their goals and planned the following activity In separate steps. In the
   performance phase, they performed their planned steps, e.g. searched for
   and read the relevant materials using computer (scientific databases as
   well as other relevant digital sources for Illustrations, pictures or
   videos). Then they prepared the presentation for their peers In which
   they explained the concept. In the final appraisal phase, they tried to
   teach the target concept to their peers, followed by the self-evaluation
   of their own performance on a scale from 0 to 10 points. The
   self-evaluation was composed from the self-comprehension of materials
   and the preparation of the presentation. The peers and a lecturer
   provided their evaluations on a scale from 0 to 10 points compounded
   from the comprehension and the presentation of the target concept.
   Students then received a calibration feedback (how many points they
   received from peers and from teacher and how many points they gave
   themselves) accessible via their personal access In the digital profile
   on the course website. The conducted multilevel model analysis revealed
   a significant Improvement In the accuracy of the self-evaluation from
   the second study week. This finding In natural environment of the
   classroom Is In line with the previous experimental research where the
   calibration feedback proves to be the most effective tool In fostering
   accuracy of the metacognitive monitoring.},

   design principles and design features from our state-of-the-art design
   requirements. Additionally, we will conduct a field experiment to put
   our theoretical contributions to test and gather practical insights. Our
   research contributes to theory by clarifying how and why gamified videos

Abstract = {Online learning is a means of reaching marginalised and disadvantaged
   students within South Africa. Nevertheless, these students encounter
   obstacles in online learning. This research investigates South African
   students' opinions regarding online learning, culminating in a model of
   important connections (facets that connect students to their learning
   and the institution). Most participants had no prior experience with
   online learning. Their perceptions and barriers to learning may apply to
   other developing countries as well.
   A cross-sequential research design was employed using a survey among 58
   fourth-year students who were studying a traditional paper-based module
   via open distance learning. The findings indicated certain essential
   connections: first, a strong social presence (through timely feedback,
   interaction with facilitators, peer-to-peer contact, discussion forums,
   and collaborative activities); second, technological aspects (technology
   access, online learning self-efficacy, and computer self-efficacy); and
   third, tools (web sites, video clips). The study revealed low levels of
   computer/internet access at home, which is of concern in an ODL milieu
   heading online. Institutions moving to online learning in developing
   countries should pay close attention to their students' situations and
   perceptions, and develop a path that would accommodate both the
   disadvantaged and techno-savvy students without compromising quality of
   education and learning. The article culminates in practical
   recommendations that encompass the main findings to help guide
   institutions in developing countries as they move towards online
   teaching and learning.},

Title = {Fostering motor skills in physical education: A mobile
   technology-supported ICRA flipped learning model},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {177},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {In order to stimulate students' active participation and thirst for
   knowledge, researchers have attempted to integrate flipped learning into
   courses, which aims to solve the problems in the traditional
   stereotypical physical skills learning mode (e.g., imitation and
   repeated practice) as well as to increase peer and teacher-student
   interaction. However, most of the flipped learning approaches use text
   for knowledge transfer, and lack guidance for practicing skills. Hence,
   the present study referred to the educational theory of reflective
   practice, and proposed the Identification, Communication, Reflection,
   and Analysis (ICRA) learning strategy. This strategy was applied to
   badminton skill learning so as to develop a flipped learning approach
   more suitable for physical skill learning. A total of 35 students were
   recruited as the experimental group, which adopted the ICRA-based mobile
   flipped learning (ICRA-MFL) approach, while 39 students in the control
   group adopted the conventional mobile flipped learning (C-MFL) approach.
   The findings indicated that the ICRA-MFL approach could significantly
   enhance students' serve accuracy, serve quality, and self-reflection.
   Based on students' feedback, it was verified that instructing students
   to identify the crucial concepts, carry out peer interaction, observe
   their practice videos, as well as providing the criteria for objective
   analysis could effectively support students' self-reflection and enhance
   their learning performance.},

Abstract = {Technology is changing and at a very rapid pace. New tools are being
   developed and coming to the forefront on almost a daily basis.
   Instructor-led workshops that train faculty and students in the use of
   new tools can be expensive propositions for educational institutions.
   Scalability and ensuring uniformity in delivery of content become
   challenges. To address the problem of making the training cost-effective
   and to facilitate self-paced, independent learning in large groups,
   EnhanceEdu employed three different training approaches to provide
   hands-on workshops in the use of the open source tool, MediaWiki, to an
   audience of students and teachers from various colleges in India. This
   paper describes the three approaches employed in conducting the hands-on
   workshops. It also determines the factors that contribute to
   participants' engagement in learning and the likelihood that they will
   continue to use the new tool.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This chapter explores whether, and how, video reflections used
   across three contexts in teacher education (video case-study
   reflections, self-reflections, and Collaborative Peer Video Analysis
   reflections) result in teachers' greater depth and breadth of reflective
   ideas about literacy assessment practices as compared to their
   reflections in just one context.
   Methodology/approach - This qualitative case study of 18 teachers tracks
   their reflective content over time, and uses emergent coding and
   constant comparative methods to identify patterns in the breadth and
   depth of teachers' reflections across three contexts: video case
   studies, self-reflections, and Collaborative Peer Video Analysis.
   Findings - Teachers demonstrate greater depth and breadth of reflection
   across the three contexts, as compared to any one context. Three
   patterns were identified that describe how teachers develop depth of
   reflection across these contexts: identifying problems, shifting
   learning, and transferring learning to novel contexts. Two patterns were
   identified that describe how breadth of reflection occurred across these
   contexts: broad array of ideas for a specific topic and a broad range of
   topics.
   Practical implications - Teacher educators can use a three-pronged
   approach to video reflection to promote depth and breadth of teachers'
   reflections. Opportunities should also be provided across time, and
   prompts should be provided for guiding reflection to support breadth and
   depth of teachers' analyses.},

Abstract = {This research aims to: 1) Identification of activity steps in project
   learning that can be recorded by video to facilitate formative
   assessment, and 2) Design a Self-Regulated Project Based Learning
   (SRPjBL) model to improve competences of Indonesian physics teacher
   candidates. The research method is done through two phases: 1) Study of
   literatures on video recording advantages in PjBL, and 2) Propose SRPjBL
   model to improve competences of physics teacher candidates through video
   recording based evaluation. The results show that the main phase of
   project learning is the inquiry activities to create new products. The
   activities are as follows: Problems challenging, preparing, planning,
   performing, and Evaluating. The process in each activity is integrated
   with self-regulation to improve competences of teacher candidates.
   Competencies are as follows: professional, pedagogic, personal, and
   social. Assessment of activities and products is easier by video
   documentation. In the future, this model can be used to explore
   competences of professional, pedagogy, and social of physics teacher
   candidates.},

Abstract = {Introduction: One of the primary missions of pharmacy education is to
   produce graduates with the foundations to develop into expert
   practitioners through continuous learning and reflection upon
   traditional and clinical experiences. This reflection process and the
   use of effective strategies to meet specific learning goals can be
   considered a form of self-regulated learning (SRL). The following study
   validates an inventory to assess SRL strategies in blended and
   team-based learning (TBL) environments.
   Methods: A SRL strategy inventory was developed based upon the
   Self-Regulated Strategies Inventory-Self-Report (SRSI-SR) and new items
   designed for blended and TBL environments. Sixteen new items focused on
   leveraging the team to learn content, the use and misuse of video
   lectures and slides, and interaction with social media and the learning
   management system. Two hundred and thirty doctor of pharmacy students in
   the third professional year participated in the study. Twenty-eight
   items from the SRSI-SR and 16 new items were examined through a
   principal components analysis (PCA).
   Results: The PCA indicated three distinct components; managing learning
   environment, maladaptive learning strategies, and seeking and learning
   information. The total inventory accounted for 46.36\% of the score.
   Maladaptive learning strategies scores were moderately predictive of
   poor academic achievement in didactic coursework.
   Conclusions: The following study demonstrates the importance of
   reexamination and adaptation of educational inventories such as the
   SRSI-SR. This study provides specific insight into what maladaptive
   strategies may be limiting underperforming students from achieving
   greater success and mastery in the didactic curriculum.},

Abstract = {PurposeTo facilitate the use of YouTube as an important global video
   portal for self-directed learning (SDL), it is important to understand
   YouTube users' distinctive learning experiences across cultures. This
   study examines factors influencing YouTube SDL based on the personal
   responsibility orientation (PRO) model. In addition, the two markets, US
   and Taiwan, were chosen to explore if national cultural differences
   affect YouTube users' SDL frequency and goals along with PRO
   variables.Design/methodology/approachA self-administered online survey
   of 372 college aged-YouTube users in the US and Taiwan was conducted to
   obtain the self-reported SDL behavior on YouTube and other demographic
   and video usage variable information.FindingsFrequent video sharing and
   information seeking motives likely facilitate general YouTube SDL, while
   initiating online video search leads to specific goal-oriented SDL such
   as problem-solving and skill-improvement. Although American students use
   YouTube more frequently for SDL than Taiwanese students, Taiwanese
   students use YouTube more for specific skill improvement.Social
   implicationsYouTube's social affordance enables YouTube users' informal
   and SDL across different national cultures and thus the role such social
   media play in encouraging lifelong learning needs further
   attention.Originality/valueThis study contributes to understanding how
   YouTube fosters the informal learning process through functions enabling
   YouTube users' self-directed information seeking, sharing and engaging
   with online videos with a cross-national comparison. This study is also
   expected to offer insights to promote the use of YouTube for SDL as a
   first cross-national study applying the PRO model in the context of
   YouTube SDL.},

Abstract = {The Orchestra Conducting training has traditionally been based on the
   imitation of the gesture of experienced conductors. It has only recently
   begun to work on other methodological alternatives for the teaching of
   gesture in the orchestral conducting. In this research, gestural
   learning in this field has been approached through self-observation
   through video with 28 students from first course in Conducting at Higher
   Music Education Conservatoire of the Basque Country Musikene. The
   results have shown that with this methodology the participants' gestural
   activity has improved, especially in those competencies more difficult
   to acquire, such as facial expression, visual contact and the use of the
   left arm. Significant differences have also been revealed in the
   improvements produced over time and in the assessments of the different
   types of judges involved. Gender differences have not been significant,
   but it is worth mentioning that women in this study have scored lower
   (themselves and others) than men. (C) 2017 Universidad de Pais Vasco.

Abstract = {This paper proposes a video-based learning environment that can evaluate
   learners' understanding and provide them with recommendations for
   reviewing sections that they did not understand sufficiently. For such
   recommendations, the system needs to recognize the video content and
   identify the parts the learners did not understand. This study develops
   the function with Kit-build concept map that allows for the automatic
   evaluation of the learners' concept maps and for review recommendations
   of the video sections the learners did not understand. To verify the
   function, we used the system as homework to prepare for a lecture. From
   the learners' log information; although only a few learners used this
   mechanism, they had a higher improvement rate in their concept maps when
   they use the function than they did not. This result shows the
   possibility of the use of KBmaps in self-learning with video lectures
   used in MOOCs, flipped learning and so on.},

Abstract = {Objective. To evaluate the effect of providing educational video
   podcasts to first-year pharmacy students enrolled in a self-taught
   pharmaceutical calculations module.
   Methods. Six video podcasts were designed and posted online for pharmacy
   students to review prior to taking pharmaceutical calculations quizzes
   over the course of one year. The video podcasts demonstrated how to
   solve the most difficult problems on each of the six quizzes. Quiz
   performance was compared for the 2017-2018 year (no videos available)
   and the 2018-2019 year (videos available). Students provided feedback
   about the videos in a year-end survey.
   Results. Overall quiz scores and passing rates improved during the
   2018-2019 academic year. Enhanced student performance on three of the
   six quizzes was demonstrated. A majority of students strongly agreed
   that the videos were helpful.
   Conclusion. Watching video podcasts was effective in improving pharmacy
   students' performance on calculations quizzes. The students indicated
   that the podcasts were helpful in improving their math skills and
   facilitated their learning of the material.},

Title = {Repeat and learn: Self-supervised visual representations learning by
   Scene Localization},
Journal = {PATTERN RECOGNITION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {156},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Large labeled datasets are crucial for video understanding progress.
   However, the labeling process is timeconsuming, expensive, and tiresome.
   To overcome this impediment, various pretexts use the temporal coherence
   in videos to learn visual representations in a self-supervised manner.
   However, these pretexts (order verification and sequence sorting)
   struggle when encountering cyclic actions due to the label ambiguity
   problem. To overcome these limitations, we present a novel temporal
   pretext task to address self-supervised learning of visual
   representations from unlabeled videos. Repeated Scene Localization (RSL)
   is a multi-class classification pretext that involves changing the
   temporal order of the frames in a video by repeating a scene. Then, the
   network is trained to identify the modified video, localize the location
   of the repeated scene, and identify the unmodified original videos that
   do not have repeated scenes. We evaluated the proposed pretext on two
   benchmark datasets, UCF-101 and HMDB-51. The experimental results show
   that the proposed pretext achieves state-of-the-art results in action
   recognition and video retrieval tasks. In action recognition, our S3D
   model achieves 88.15\% and 56.86\% on UCF-101 and HMDB-51, respectively.
   It outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 1.05\% and 3.26\%. Our
   R(2+1)D-Adjacent model achieves 83.52\% and 54.50\% on UCF-101 and
   HMDB-51, respectively. It outperforms the single pretext tasks by 8.7\%
   and 13.9\%. In video retrieval, our R(2+1)D-Offset model outperforms the
   single pretext tasks by 4.68\% and 1.1\% Top 1 accuracies on UCF-101 and
   HMDB-51, respectively. The source code and the trained models are

Title = {The moderating effect of self-regulated learning skills on online
   learning behaviour in blended learning},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 29},
Abstract = {BackgroundEnhancing the effectiveness of online learning has become a
   key challenge with regard to the ability of blended learning to reach
   its full potential. However, mechanisms by which students'
   self-regulated learning (SRL) skills influence their online learning
   engagement in blended learning and subsequent learning achievement have
   yet to be explored fully.ObjectivesThis study aims to explore the
   mechanisms underlying the effects of students' SRL skills on online
   learning behaviour and learning achievement in blended
   learning.MethodsBased on students' self-reported data and learning
   behavioural data, this study employed a combination of structural
   equation modelling and learning analytics to conduct an in-depth
   investigation into the influence of SRL skills on online learning
   behaviour and blended learning achievement.ResultsThe results indicated
   that the duration spent on challenging mandatory tasks mediates the
   relationship between psychological engagement and learning achievement;
   Two SRL skills, task strategies and self-evaluation, played positive
   moderating roles in the relationship between psychological engagement
   and online behavioural engagement. Further analysis of behavioural
   sequences revealed that these two skills influenced students'
   behavioural patterns during video learning and their effectiveness in
   error attribution during exercises. Additionally, self-evaluation
   impacted the approach to quizzes and error correction during
   exercises.TakeawayThe findings of this research enrich and advance the
   understanding of characteristics and processes of SRL in blended
   learning contexts and have important implications for both instructional
   design and learning support in the context of blended K-12 learning.
   What is already known about this topic Elementary and secondary school
   students' level of SRL skills is an important factor influencing the
   effectiveness of blended learning. Behavioural indicators that are more
   relevant to cognitive engagement are stronger predictors of learning
   performance. Students with different levels of SRL skills exhibit
   different characteristics of learning behaviour. Mechanisms by which
   students' SRL skills influence their online learning engagement in
   blended learning and learning achievement have yet to be explored
   fully.What this paper adds The duration spent on challenging mandatory
   tasks is a key indicator of psychological engagement, which mediates the
   relationship between psychological engagement and learning achievement
   in blended learning. Task strategies and self-evaluation are the key SRL
   skills moderating the impact of psychological engagement in blended
   learning on online behavioural engagement. These two skills influenced
   students' behavioural patterns during video learning and their
   effectiveness in error attribution during exercises. Additionally,
   Self-evaluation impacted the approach to quizzes and error correction
   during exercises.Implications for practice and/or policy Mandatory
   online tasks with appropriate challenges can effectively stimulate
   substantial online learning engagement, and students' behavioural
   engagement in such tasks can be used as a predictor of learning
   achievement in blended learning. Enhancing students' SRL skills in both
   task strategies and self-evaluation can significantly improve learning
   behaviours and then achievement in blended learning. Behavioural
   patterns exhibited by students during video learning and testing offer a
   foundational framework for the assessment and enhancement of SRL in
   blended learning.},

Abstract = {Students' ability to accurately self-assess their performance and select
   a suitable subsequent learning task in response is imperative for
   effective self-regulated learning. Video modeling examples have proven
   effective for training self-assessment and task-selection skills,
   andimportantlysuch training fostered self-regulated learning outcomes.
   It is unclear, however, whether trained skills would transfer across
   domains. We investigated whether skills acquired from training with
   either a specific, algorithmic task-selection rule or a more general
   heuristic task-selection rule in biology would transfer to
   self-regulated learning in math. A manipulation check performed after
   the training confirmed that both algorithmic and heuristic training
   improved task-selection skills on the biology problems compared with the
   control condition. However, we found no evidence that students
   subsequently applied the acquired skills during self-regulated learning
   in math. Future research should investigate how to support transfer of
   task-selection skills across domains.},

Abstract = {Mobile technologies are part of our daily lives and most of the new
   generations. Hernandez {[}7] states that the organizational environment
   of our educational institutions, and the whole process of teaching and
   learning becomes too predictable, being too static and uninteresting to
   the characteristics of current students. We understand that it can't be
   limited to learning a unique context in which the teacher assumes the
   role of sole holder of knowledge supported by textbooks.
   A wide range of information to which students have access, for example
   through mobile internet connection, which own or use with great ease.
   Assume that we are part of the knowledge society is risky, because there
   is still much to do to take advantage of the technologies in education.
   The technological development that we live in the XXI century, in the
   area of information and communication technologies (ICT) perspective an
   education supported by digital media, including the Internet, mobile
   devices, social networks, applications called Web 2.0, means that play a
   prominent role and are we as true of online learning networks, anywhere
   and anytime.
   In this research we propose to study the potential of hybrid and
   personal learning environments in contexts of higher education, to
   promote reflection, collaborative work and content management among
   students. To this end we resort to an open access platform, SAPO Campus,
   developed at the University of Aveiro-Portugal (http://campus.sapo.pt),
   but it provides a register and setup an online learning community and
   working groups.
   For the development of network learning is necessary to believe that,
   ``digital learning styles include fluency in new media, online
   communities, guided mentoring, video games, or collective reflection via
   blogs, podcasts, wiki's, Flickr, Twitter, and other forms of social
   Media. Effective online learning design shouldnt Provide engaging
   content Which Allows the pupil to draw connections between the context
   of the learning objectives while Utilizing various forms of social media
   {[}3]: s/w.
   Attwell (2007) reveals that the PLE provide a new approach of using
   technologies for learning (cit in {[}4]). Adell and Castaoeda (2010)
   suggest that PLE are set of tools, information sources, connections and
   activities that each person uses assiduously to learn {[}4].
   This qualititativo-driven research refers to research-action methodology
   and is being developed at the Polytechnic Institute of Viseu, in the
   School of Education in the school year 2014/2015. The participants are
   students of the Bachelor of Social Education and Basic Education Degree.
   As data collection techniques we will use a Interaction Analysis Model
   for Online Communities {[}9], in order to assess the participation of
   each student on an individual perspective and self-reflection on
   participation in this community. The first collection and processing of
   data reveals interesting findings in terms of self-learning, such as the
   proper time management in carrying out activities and greater motivation
   for participation.},

Abstract = {In Video-Language (VL) learning tasks, a massive amount of text
   annotations are describing geometrical relationships of instances (e.g.,
   19.6\% to 45.0\% in MSVD, MSR-VTT, MSVD-QA and MSVRTTQA), which often
   become the bottleneck of the current VL tasks (e.g., 60.8\% vs. 98.2\%
   CIDEr in MSVD for geometrical and non-geometrical annotations).
   Considering the rich spatial information of depth map, an intuitive way
   is to enrich the conventional 2D visual representations with depth
   information through current SOTA models, i.e., transformer. However, it
   is cumbersome to compute the self-attention on a long-range sequence and
   heterogeneous video-level representations with regard to computation
   cost and flexibility on various frame scales. To tackle this, we propose
   a hierarchical transformer, termed Depth-Aware Sparse Transformer
   (DAST). Specifically, to guarantee computational efficiency, a
   depth-aware sparse attention modular with linear computational
   complexity is designed for each transformer layer to learn depth-aware
   2D representations. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical structure to
   maintain multi-scale temporal coherence across long-range dependencies.
   These qualities of DAST make it compatible with a broad range of
   video-language tasks, including video captioning (achieving MSVD
   107.8\%, MSR-VTT 52.5\% for CIDEr), video question answering (MSVD-QA
   44.1\%, MSRVTT-QA 39.4\%), and video-text matching (MSR-VTT 215.7 for
   SumR). Our code is available at https://github.com/zchoi/DAST.},

Abstract = {Research on immersive learning in natural setting such as schools,
   especially with/in virtual reality (VR), is only just emerging. While
   current inquiry concentrates on measuring content and procedural
   knowledge acquisition and to a lesser extent attitudinal change
   associated with exposure to VR applications, scant attention has been
   paid to what learners actually do in immersive virtual environments.
   This includes on- and off-task behavior, higher order thinking, and
   regulation of learning related to self and others. This methodological
   paper describes the use of screen capture video as a means of recording
   and analysing these types of learning behaviors in virtual environments
   with junior high school students. The paper outlines barriers,
   limitations and benefits to using screen capture video and the types of
   inductive and deductive analysis conducted as part of the research. It
   concludes that screen capture video is a promising medium for
   understanding verbal and non-verbal learning behavior as it actually
   unfolds in immersive VR.},

Abstract = {This study gives voice to individual students' reflective
   interpretations of the challenges that they face during collaborative
   learning. It shows how students describe their strategic activities to
   overcome these challenges and illustrates how the described challenges
   are actualized in practice. Forty-three second-year teacher education
   students worked in small groups during a seven week didactic math
   course. Individual students were interviewed after the course and asked
   about their interpretations of their collaboration in general, as well
   as their applied strategic activities during challenging collaborative
   learning situations. The data was complemented with two student groups'
   video recordings dealing with the group work in order to analyze how the
   students identified challenges during their collaboration and what types
   of strategic activities they used to solve these issues. The results
   showed how students' strategic activities varied among different
   challenging situations. The students were able to identify and solve the
   cognitive learning challenges in particular. In contrast, motivational
   and emotional learning challenges were not recognized and solved that
   often. It is concluded that ignoring the challenges that students are
   experiencing can affect their collaboration in many ways such as
   creating a general work atmosphere, causing unequal participation or
   lower satisfaction with group learning.},

Abstract = {Face recognition (FR) is employed in several video surveillance
   applications to determine if facial regions captured over a network of
   cameras correspond to a target individuals. To enroll target
   individuals, it is often costly or unfeasible to capture enough high
   quality reference facial samples a priori to design representative
   facial models. Furthermore, changes in capture conditions and physiology
   contribute to a growing divergence between these models and faces
   captured during operations. Adaptive biometrics seek to maintain a high
   level of performance by updating facial models over time using
   operational data. Adaptive multiple classifier systems (MCSs) have been
   successfully applied to video-to-video FR, where the face of each target
   individual is modeled using an ensemble of 2-class classifiers (trained
   using target vs. non-target samples). In this paper, a new adaptive MCS
   is proposed for partially-supervised learning of facial models over time
   based on facial trajectories. During operations, information from a face
   tracker and individual-specific ensembles is integrated for robust
   spatio-temporal recognition and for selfupdate of facial models. The
   tracker defines a facial trajectory for each individual that appears in
   a video, which leads to the recognition of a target individual if the
   positive predictions accumulated along a trajectory surpass a detection
   threshold for an ensemble. When the number of positive ensemble
   predictions surpasses a higher update threshold, then all target face
   samples from the trajectory are combined with non-target samples
   (selected from the cohort and universal models) to update the
   corresponding facial model. A learn-and-combine strategy is employed to
   avoid knowledge corruption during selfupdate of ensembles. In addition,
   a memory management strategy based on Kullback-Leibler divergence is
   proposed to rank and select the most relevant target and non-target
   reference samples to be stored in memory as the ensembles evolves. For
   proof-of-concept, a particular realization of the proposed system was
   validated with videos from Face in Action dataset. Initially,
   trajectories captured from enrollment videos are used for supervised
   learning of ensembles, and then videos from various operational sessions
   are presented to the system for FR and self-update with high-confidence
   trajectories. At a transaction level, the proposed approach outperforms
   baseline systems that do not adapt to new trajectories, and provides
   comparable performance to ideal systems that adapt to all relevant
   target trajectories, through supervised learning. Subject-level analysis
   reveals the existence of individuals for which self-updating ensembles
   with unlabeled facial trajectories provides a considerable benefit.
   Trajectory-level analysis indicates that the proposed system allows for
   robust spatio-temporal video-to-video FR, and may therefore enhance
   security and situation analysis in video surveillance. (C) 2014 Elsevier

Abstract = {Outdoor adventure education courses are used in higher education to
   develop transferable skills such as groupwork and problem-solving
   skills. There is a need for exploratory investigation into students'
   perceptions of this experience. This study aimed to develop an
   innovative qualitative data collection method, and to use it to explore
   students' perceived learning processes and developmental outcomes when
   taking part in an outdoor groupwork skills course. Participants (n = 40)
   were undergraduate engineering students who were taking part in the 3
   day residential course as part of their degree course. Students'
   experiences were captured whilst immersed in the course, using a
   semi-structured video diary room. Participants entered the diary room at
   different time points throughout the course and responded to openended
   questions. Following a thematic analysis, students were found to arrive
   on the course with mixed feelings towards groupwork and expected
   learning outcomes. Activities were enjoyable yet challenging, revealing
   students' weaknesses and demanding a range of skills and coping methods.
   The outdoor environment added novelty, risk and natural consequences.
   Students reported developing a range of skills in groupwork,
   adaptability, persistence, planning, problem-solving, time-management,
   communication, leadership, cooperation, group reflection and team
   spirit, as well as benefits to physical activity, self-confidence,
   self-awareness, peer and staff relationships and internationalisation.
   These findings provide a base for future investigation into the
   long-term impact on student development and skill transfer. The
   semi-structured video diary room yielded rich data, contributing to the
   literature by offering a simple, yet effective, qualitative research
   method that can be implemented in a variety of contexts.},

Volume = {32},

Abstract = {Background With medical education shifting towards competency-based
   models, medical students are expected to be self-directed lifelong
   learners. There is an urgent need to understand what technology students
   adopt for self-directed learning and what factors contributed to
   students' self-initiated technology use. Method This study took place in
   a midwestern university medical school, which implements a flipped
   classroom model where students are required to learn all the course
   materials independently before class. Twenty-six first- and second-year
   medical students participated in a semi-structured interview about their
   self-directed learning with technology, and contributing factors towards
   technology use. A qualitative description methodology using thematic
   analysis was used to identify key themes from the interview data.
   Results Medical students reported using four types of technologies for
   learning video resources, self-assessment tools, management tools, and
   social media. Three key determinants of students' self-directed
   technology use were identified, including perceived usefulness,
   subjective norms, and educational compatibility. Conclusions By probing
   medical students' self-initiated technology use and its determinants,
   this study suggested that in a self-directed learning environment,
   medical students used a variety of third-party resources to facilitate
   learning and develop self-directed learning skills. This study also
   provided important practical implications to better support students'
   productive use of technologies for self-directed learning.},

Title = {Affect in Peer Group Learning During Virtual Science Inquiry: Insights
   From Self-Reports and Video Observations},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JAN 14},
Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to explore affect in small groups learning
   together face-to-face in a virtual learning environment. The specific
   aims of the study were to establish how affect within groups (valence,
   intensity) related to the quality of group outcome (high, average, low),
   and to capture individual differences within the groups by using a
   multimethod approach. Participants were six groups of three high school
   students (N = 18) who achieved distinct outcome levels. Students'
   self-reports of their affect and observed affect (researcher-coded
   selected segments from videos) were used to examine affect during three
   phases of interdisciplinary science inquiry, namely, planning the
   experiment, experimenting in the virtual laboratory, and concluding and
   preparing a joint group presentation. The overall results showed that
   positive affect was prevalent in both self-reports and researcher-coded
   observations across all phases. However, while self-reports displayed a
   strong dominance of positive affect, there was more variation in
   observed affect. Furthermore, the intensity of affect was higher in
   self-reports than in observations, for both positive and negative
   affect. Nonetheless, no effect of affect on group outcome was found.
   Finally, while within-group consistency in affect was evident in the
   extreme groups (high, low performance), it was more ambivalent in the
   groups that achieved an average performance. The results are discussed
   in light of the literature, and directions for future research on affect
   in collaborative learning are proposed.},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Volume = {195},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The goal of the current study was to investigate the effects of
   affective pedagogical agent (PA) and student-generated explanation on
   learners' affective processing, visual attention, and learning outcomes
   during a video lesson. In a 2 (affective pedagogical agent: positive PA
   vs. neutral PA) x 2 (generative learning strategy: self-explanation vs.
   re-study) between-subjects design, partici-pants watched an animation on
   synaptic transmission from a multimedia lesson that was either delivered
   by a positive PA or a neutral PA. After watching the video, students
   either generated a verbal explanation or rewatched the video. All
   students' eye movements were tracked during learning and then took
   learning outcome tests. The results showed that: (a) students who
   learned with a positive PA paid more attention to relevant elements of
   the materials and performed better on learning outcomes than those who
   learned with a neutral PA; (b) self-explanation facilitated visual
   processing and learning outcomes; and (c) positive PA accompanying
   self-explanation increased intrinsic motivation and resulted in best
   learning performance. The findings support the use of a positive PA to
   design multimedia learning environments and the use of self -explanation
   strategy to engage students in generative processing activities.
   Moreover, students benefit most from positive PA and then generating an
   oral explanation, which demonstrates the importance of combining
   instructional design features and learners-generated learning activity
   in computer-based learning environments.},

Title = {Enhancing Example-Based Learning: Teaching on Video Increases Arousal
   and Improves Problem-Solving Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},

Abstract = {Recent findings show that after studying a text, teaching the learned
   content on video to a fictitious peer student improves learning more
   than restudying the content. This benefit may be in part due to
   increased arousal associated with the teaching activity. The present
   experiment investigated whether teaching on video is also effective for
   acquiring problem-solving skills from worked examples, and explored the
   role of cognitive load, worry, and arousal. Participants (N = 61
   university students) first studied two worked examples on electrical
   circuits troubleshooting and completed a practice problem. Then they
   either taught the content of a worked example of the practice problem on
   video (teaching condition) or studied that worked example (control
   condition) for the same amount of time. Self-reported cognitive load was
   measured after each task and self-reported worry after the final task.
   Effects on arousal were explored via the Empatica wristband measuring
   electrodermal activity (EDA; i.e., galvanic skin response). Teaching the
   content of the worked example on video was not associated with more
   worry, but did result in higher perceived cognitive load, more arousal,
   and better performance on isomorphic and transfer problems on the
   posttest. Although this finding has to be interpreted with caution,
   teaching also seemed to moderate the effect of prior knowledge on
   transfer that was present in the study condition. This suggests that
   teaching is particularly effective for students who initially have low
   prior knowledge.
   Educational Impact and Implications Statement
   Studying examples of how to solve a problem is a very effective way of
   learning new problem-solving skills. We examined whether the
   effectiveness of example study could be enhanced further by teaching the
   content of an example in front of a camera to a fictitious peer student.
   Our findings indicate that after an initial study phase, teaching the
   content of an example on video results in better performance on problems
   on a posttest than studying the example for the same duration. This
   benefit does not seem to be a result of the increased excitement/arousal
   associated with the teaching activity. This study provides further
   evidence that teaching on video is an effective learning strategy, which
   could be interesting and relatively easy to implement for educational
   practice.},

Abstract = {Social media has been postulated as a convenient online resource tool
   for learning. To understand the usefulness of social media, the present
   study focused on ``Guitar Class of Uncle Ma{''}, one of YouTube's most
   popular guitar learning channels in Taiwan, as a self-directed learning
   tool. Drawing upon a cognitive-affective theory of learning with media
   (CATLM), learners have the ability to control the pace of learning
   through YouTube by repeating playback, rewinding or fast forwarding the
   video. This study used expectation confirmation theory and structural
   equation modeling to explore the relationship between affective and
   cognitive factors in learning with social media. Using convenience
   sampling, data from 117 users were collected and the results showed
   Internet cognitive failure (ICF) was negatively correlated to
   self-efficacy and learning interest in using ``Guitar Class of Uncle
   Ma{''} for learning guitar skills. However, self-efficacy and learning
   interest was positively correlated to learning satisfaction. The results
   suggest that ``Guitar Class of Uncle Ma{''} is a beneficial
   self-directed learning tool for learners with low levels of Internet
   cognitive failure and high levels of self-efficacy and learning interest
   when learning how to play guitar using YouTube. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Abstract = {Synchronous online learning via technology has become a major trend in
   institutions of higher education, allowing students to learn from video
   lectures alongside their peers online. However, relatively little
   research has focused on the influence of these peers on students'
   learning during video lectures and even less on the effect of peer
   familiarity. The present study aimed to test the various effects of peer
   presence and peer familiarity on learning from video lectures. There
   were three experimental conditions: individual-learning, paired-learning
   with an unfamiliar peer, and paired-learning with a familiar peer.
   ANCOVA results found that students paired with a familiar peer reported
   higher motivation in learning and more self-monitoring behaviors than
   those paired with an unfamiliar peer or who learned alone. Furthermore,
   students paired with both unfamiliar or familiar peers demonstrated
   better learning transfer than those who learned alone. Together, these
   results confirm the benefits of and support learning alongside a
   familiar peer during video lectures.},

Abstract = {This paper explores the effectiveness of various video-based learning
   methods. In recent years the flipped classroom has emerged as an
   innovative teaching-learning process. In a flipped classroom, study
   materials are made available to students for self-learning before class
   starts and class hours are utilized for student-teacher interaction in a
   variety of ways. In this research work we experiment with three broad
   scenarios to facilitate learning: a) delivering the lecture live and
   providing the entire recorded video of the class to the students, b)
   delivering the lecture live and providing short videos of the main
   concepts discussed in that class, c) recording lecture videos and making
   them available prior to the actual class (flip classroom model). We
   evaluate the impact of these three scenarios. For that we use
   observations, questionnaires, and interviews of both instructor and
   students for a semester course in Digital Image Processing. The results
   show that recorded videos are useful for students. Among these scenarios
   the students find the methodology of the delivery of the live lecture
   followed by short recorded video summary as the most effective way for
   learning.},

Title = {Linguistic characteristics of reflective states in video annotations

Abstract = {Video-based self-reflection and annotation is receiving increasing
   attention within the education literature. The importance of such
   technologies in education relate, in part, to the interactive nature and
   functionality these tools bring to aid learning engagement. In
   particular, these tools are well aligned with the need to promote and
   develop student meta-cognitive skills through the use of self-reflection
   activities. However, in the context of video-based learning
   environments, the nature of a students' self-reflective process is not
   well understood. We attempt to address this gap in the literature in two
   main ways. First, we developed a coding instrument to assess the depth
   of a students' self-reflection captured through the use of a video
   annotation tool. We then explored the linguistic and discourse
   properties of the student self-reflections using Coh-Metrix, a
   theoretically grounded computational linguistics facility. The adopted
   approach applies comprehensive analysis of language and discourse
   features associated with the specificity of students' internal
   self-feedback, which is externalized as self-reflections in video
   annotations. The results suggest that levels of self-reflection have
   characteristically different linguistic properties, and these
   differences align with the underlying cognitive mechanisms associated
   with distinct reflective activities. The paper provides a detailed
   discussion of the findings in the context of the theoretical,
   methodological, and practical implications associated with video-based
   self-reflection and video annotation. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {Guided inquiry learning is an effective method for learning about
   scientific concepts. The present study investigated the effects of
   combining video modeling (VM) examples and metacognitive prompts on
   university students' (N = 127) scientific reasoning and self-regulation
   during inquiry learning. We compared the effects of watching VM examples
   combined with prompts (VMP) to watching VM examples only, and to
   unguided inquiry (control) in a training and a transfer task. Dependent
   variables were scientific reasoning ability, hypothesis and
   argumentation quality, and scientific reasoning and self-regulation
   processes. Participants in the VMP and VM conditions had higher
   hypothesis and argumentation quality in the training task and higher
   hypothesis quality in the transfer task compared to the control group.
   There was no added benefit of the prompts. Screen captures and think
   aloud protocols during the two tasks served to obtain insights into
   students' scientific reasoning and self-regulation processes. Epistemic
   network analysis (ENA) and process mining were used to model the
   co-occurrence and sequences of these processes. The ENA identified
   stronger co-occurrences between scientific reasoning and self-regulation
   processes in the two VM conditions compared to the control condition.
   Process mining revealed that in the VM conditions these processes
   occurred in unique sequences and that self-regulation processes had many
   self-loops. Our findings show that video modeling examples are a
   promising instructional method for supporting inquiry learning on both
   the process and the learning outcomes level.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Medical education is changing and evolving. Teachers need
   to re-evaluate their medical teaching practice to enhance student
   learning. The data about the ideal training method of Basic Life Support
   (BLS) is lacking. The goal of this study was to analyse the use and
   performance of video self-instruction (VSI) method in BLS, in order to
   develop an efficient BLS training method. Methods: Eighty-one
   undergraduate medical interns were enrolled in a prospective clinical
   study in 2011. They were divided into VSI group and traditional group.
   We provided the first group with a DVD containing a 20-minute training
   video while the second group took part in a 4-hour training class of
   BLS. Subjects participated in a pre-test and post-test based on 2010
   American Heart Association Resuscitation guideline. Results: The average
   scores of VSI group and the traditional group before training were 8.85
   +/- 2.42 and 8.57 +/- 2.22 respectively (p=0.592). After training, the
   average scores of the VSI and the traditional group were 20.24 +/- 0.83
   and 18.05 +/- 1.86 respectively. VSI group achieved slightly better
   scores compared with the traditional group (p<0.001). Conclusions:
   Training through VSI achieves more satisfying results than the
   traditional lecture method. VSI method can be considered a useful
   technique in undergraduate educational programs. Developing VSI can
   increase significantly the access to the BLS training.},

Abstract = {Understanding the role individual beliefs play when the group faces
   challenge is key in understanding the shared regulation processes and
   participation that lead to collaborative learning success. As of now,
   there is not much research focusing on how self-efficacy plays a role in
   regulation taking place in collaborative group settings. Therefore, the
   aim of this study is to explore how situational self-efficacy beliefs
   relate to students' participation in group level regulation during a
   collaborative task. The study involved 18 university students working in
   groups on a computer-based collaborative task. Repeated self-reports
   measuring group members' self-efficacy were related to performance
   feedback from the task as well as participation in group level
   regulation identified from videotaped collaborative working. The results
   showed that self-efficacy varied depending on the nature of performance
   feedback. In addition, the way students participated in regulation was
   connected with their level of self-efficacy: low self-efficacy was
   associated with taking a passive role in regulation whereas high
   self-efficacy was associated with taking an active role. The study
   suggests that situational self-efficacy beliefs are associated with the
   participation roles during group level regulation, thus being of
   practical concern for educators seeking to support learners'
   self-efficacy and active participation in collaborative learning.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAs adequate support, virtual reality (VR) has been
   increasingly introduced into the classroom to help students learn a new
   language. However, empirical studies exploring the educational potential
   of using 360 degrees spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) in
   high-school Chinese language classrooms are still lacking. ObjectivesA
   mind mapping-based SVVR learning system is proposed for international
   high-school students' Chinese courses and examines its effects on
   improving Chinese learning achievements and perceptions among Grade 10
   students who learn Chinese as a foreign language. MethodsThis study
   adopted a quasi-experiment design. Participants (N = 66) were assigned
   to one of three conditions: mind mapping-based SVVR (MMBSVVR),
   conventional SVVR (CSVVR), or traditional lecturing (TL). Our
   mixed-method approach employed pre-and post-tests to measure Chinese
   learning achievements, questionnaires to measure Chinese learning
   motivation, problem-solving ability, and self-efficacy, and
   semi-structured interviews to further explore students' feelings and
   attitudes about Chinese courses in corresponding learning environments.
   Results and ConclusionsThe results showed that the MMBSVVR classroom
   significantly improved high students' Chinese learning achievements in
   Chinese vocabulary and making sentence, problem-solving ability, and
   self-efficacy. Moreover, SVVR stimulates students' learning interest and
   class participation, and mind mapping provides students with a clear
   guide to arrange the knowledge. These findings help interpret the
   relationships between MMBSVVR and learning achievements, Chinese
   learning motivation, problem-solving ability, and self-efficacy in an
   international high school Chinese courses, thus providing insight on
   integrating MMBSVVR into existing classrooms.},

Abstract = {Weakly supervised video anomaly detection is generally formulated as a
   multiple instance learning (MIL) problem, where an anomaly detector
   learns to generate frame-level anomaly scores under the supervision of
   MIL-based video-level classification. However, most previous works
   suffer from two drawbacks: 1) they lack ability to model temporal
   relationships between video segments and 2) they cannot extract
   sufficient discriminative features to separate normal and anomalous
   snippets. In this article, we develop a weakly supervised temporal
   discriminative (WSTD) paradigm, that aims to leverage both temporal
   relation and feature discrimination to mitigate the above drawbacks. To
   this end, we propose a transformer-styled temporal feature aggregator
   (TTFA) and a self-guided discriminative feature encoder (SDFE).
   Specifically, TTFA captures multiple types of temporal relationships
   between video snippets from different feature subspaces, while SDFE
   enhances the discriminative powers of features by clustering normal
   snippets and maximizing the separability between anomalous snippets and
   normal centers in embedding space. Experimental results on three public
   benchmarks indicate that WSTD outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised
   and weakly supervised methods, which verifies the superiority of the
   proposed method.},

Abstract = {To avoid any fallacious assumption on the degeneration procedure in
   preparing training data, some self-similarity based super-resolution
   (SR) algorithms have been proposed to exploit the internal recurrence of
   patches without relying on external datasets. However, the network
   architectures of those ``zero-shot{''} SR methods are often shallow.
   Otherwise they would suffer from the over-fitting problem due to the
   limited samples within a single image. This restricts the strong power
   of deep neural networks (DNNs). To relieve this problem, we propose a
   middle-layer feature loss to allow the network architecture to be deeper
   for handling the video super-resolution (VSR) task in a self-supervised
   way. Specifically, we constrain the middle-layer feature of VSR network
   to be as similar as that of the corresponding single image
   super-resolution (SISR) in a Spatial Module, then fuse the inter-frame
   information in a Temporal Fusion Module. Experimental results
   demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves significantly superior
   results on real-world data in comparison with some state-of-the-art
   methods.},

Title = {Efficacy of Video-Based Forearm Anatomy Model Instruction for a Virtual
   Education Environment},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL EDUCATION AND CURRICULAR DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: As virtual education becomes more widespread, particularly
   considering the recent COVID-19 pandemic, studies that assess the impact
   of online teaching strategies are vital. Current anatomy curriculum at
   Paul L. Foster School of Medicine consists of self-taught PowerPoint
   material, clinical vignette-centered team-based learning (dry lab), and
   prosection-based instruction (wet lab). This study examined the impact
   of video-based muscle model (VBMM) instruction using a student-designed
   forearm muscle model on anatomy quiz scores and student perceptions of
   its effectiveness with regards to learning outcomes.
   METHODS: Students divided into Group 1 (54 students) and Group 2 (53
   students) were assessed prior to and following a 3.5-minute video on
   anterior forearm compartment musculature using the muscle model. Group 1
   began by completing a pretest, then received VBMM instruction, and then
   completed a posttest prior to participating in the standard dry lab and
   1 hour wet lab. Group 2 completed the wet lab, then received the
   pretest, VBMM instruction, and posttest prior to participating in the
   dry lab. Both groups took an identical five-question quiz covering
   locations and functions of various anterior forearm muscles each time.
   RESULTS: Mean scores were higher than no formal intervention with
   exposure to VBMM instruction alone (0.73 points, P=.01), wet lab alone
   (0.88 points, P=.002), and wet lab plus VBMM instruction (1.35 points,
   P=<.001). No significant difference in scores was found between
   instruction with VBMM versus wet lab alone (P= 1.00), or between either
   instruction method alone compared to a combination of the two methods
   (P=.34,.09). Student survey opinions on the VBMM instruction method were
   positive.
   CONCLUSION: VBMM instruction is comparable to prosection-based lab with
   regards to score outcomes and was well received by students as both an
   independent learning tool and as a supplement to cadaveric lab. When
   compared to either instruction method alone, the supplementation of VBMM
   with cadaveric prosection instruction was best. VBMM instruction may be
   valuable for institutions without access to cadaveric specimens, or
   those looking to supplement their current anatomy curriculum.},

Abstract = {Self-explanation prompts in example-based learning are usually directed
   backwards: Learners are required to self-explain problem-solving steps
   just presented (retrospective prompts). However, it might also help to
   self-explain upcoming steps (anticipatory prompts). The effects of the
   prompt type may differ for learners with various expertise levels, with
   anticipatory prompts being better for learners with more expertise. In
   an experiment, we employed extensive modelling examples and different
   types of self-explanations prompts to teach 78 automotive apprentices a
   complex and job-relevant problem-solving strategy, namely the diagnosis
   of car malfunctions. We tested the effects of these modelling examples
   and self-explanation prompts on problem-solving strategy knowledge and
   skill, self-efficacy, and cognitive load while learning. In two
   conditions, the apprentices learned with modelling examples and received
   either retrospective or anticipatory prompts. The third condition was a
   control condition receiving no modelling examples, but the respective
   open problems. In comparison with the control condition, modelling
   examples did not promote learning. However, we observed differential
   effects of the self-explanation prompts depending on the learner's prior
   knowledge level. Apprentices with higher prior knowledge learned more
   when learning with anticipatory prompts. Apprentices with less prior
   knowledge experienced a greater increase in self-efficacy and a higher
   germane cognitive load when learning with retrospective prompts. These
   findings suggest using different self-explanation prompts for learners
   possessing varying levels of expertise.},

Abstract = {Dental education can benefit from adopting new technologies and modern
   learning practices. Video-assisted clinical instruction in dentistry
   (VACID) uses video technology with the purpose of enhancing the teaching
   of technical skills and the acquisition of clinical knowledge, as well
   as fostering student-centered learning and critical self-appraisal.
   VACID is made possible through the capturing, recording, transmitting
   and viewing of high quality video images of live or pre-recorded
   clinical procedures. As such, the implementation of VACID represents an
   attractive teaching tool that can complement and strengthen current
   clinical and didactic teaching practices used in formal dental
   education. The primary objective of this paper is to provide an overview
   of VACID and discuses its various applications in dental education. A
   second objective of this paper is to provide a detailed description of
   the video camera set-up used at the University of Iowa for the
   implementation of VACID in the Department of Periodontics.},

Title = {Enriched videos and the flipped classroom: learning and satisfaction
   multipliers during an escape room in Primary Education},
Journal = {BORDON-REVISTA DE PEDAGOGIA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {76},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION. Learning is not always easy or motivating for primary
   school students, especially when lesson content is somewhat abstract or
   theoretical. Active learning methodologies and the use of information
   and communication technology can help to increase motivation and promote
   meaningful, long-lasting learning among students. METHOD. In this study,
   we analyse a teaching unit focusing on Spanish language and literature
   in 5(th) of Primary (N=34). A flipped-classroom approach was used
   because students had to watch some video content before beginning the
   teaching unit at school. Some students watched interactive videos that
   had been enriched with questions that they had to answer to be able to
   continue, while other students watched conventional videos. The learning
   situation was presented in the form of an escape room over five
   sessions. RESULTS. The students who had watched the enriched videos
   obtained statistically higher scores than the students who had watched
   the conventional videos, in terms of content learning, and satisfaction
   with the teaching and learning process for the unit. No significant
   differences were observed between the two groups regarding digital
   competence (DC) or motivational aspects, although there was an increase
   in the trend of attribution to luck and a decrease in attribution to the
   teacher, by students who had watched enriched videos. DISCUSSION. The
   enriched videos used in the flipped classroom helped students gain a
   better understanding of the content needed for the sessions, producing
   improved learning outcomes and generating greater satisfaction among
   students. As expected, students' digital competence did not improve
   through this process; as recent studies have shown, this would require
   specific training. While the motivational and attributional aspects
   merit further research, the educational implications of this learning
   process are herein discussed.},

Abstract = {Digital technology and its use within democratic pedagogy has been an

   explores student perceptions and experiences of democratic assessment
   practices through video narratives in HE PE and how these video
   narratives allowed students to demonstrate their learning. Using student
   responses from an e-questionnaire, the findings discuss how the video
   narratives elevate students' self-awareness, generate emotive and
   affective responses, elicit performative acts and provide an authentic
   assessment experience. In particular, the consideration of a student's
   environment is presented as a novel finding in comparison to previous
   literature. The authors discuss these findings in relation to teachers'

Abstract = {Video-based learning offers a learner a self-paced, lucid, memorizable,
   and a flexible way of learning. The availability of abundant educational
   video materials on the web has certainly abetted an individual's
   learning means. But the lack of necessary information about the videos
   makes it difficult for the learner to search and select the exact video
   as per his/her requirement and suitability in terms of the learner's
   learning capability and the material's relevancy, difficulty level, etc.
   Educational video recommendation systems also suffer from a similar
   problem. Extracting the required metadata, by different means, from the
   learning videos is a plausible solution. Despite the credible research
   efforts on video metadata extraction, the problem of educational video
   metadata extraction has been overlooked. This paper proposes a
   comprehensive approach to extract educational metadata from a learning
   video. A semiautomatic mechanism that includes manual and computational
   approaches is introduced for metadata extraction and to evaluate the
   values of these metadata. Along with identifying a set of specific
   metadata attributes from IEEE LOM, few additional attributes are
   suggested which are imperative to assess the suitability of a
   video-based learning object in terms of the personalized preference and
   suitability of a learner. The test results are validated by comparing
   with the manually extracted metadata by experts, on the same videos. The
   outcome establishes the promising effectiveness of the approach.},

   Courses},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {In MOOCs, learners are typically presented with great autonomy over
   their learning process. Therefore, learners should engage in
   self-regulated learning (SRL) in order to successfully study in a MOOC.
   Learners however often struggle to self-regulate their learning. We
   implemented an SRL intervention in three MOOCs. The intervention
   consisted of three short videos containing SRL instruction and study
   suggestions to improve learners' SRL. We tested the effects of the SRL
   intervention on both learners' course completion as well as on learners'
   SRL. Learners' SRL was measured with trace data variables indicating SRL
   activity. The results showed that the intervention positively affected
   learners' course completion. Furthermore, the learners who complied with
   the intervention also engaged in more SRL activities compared to the
   learners in the control condition: learners who complied showed more
   metacognitive activities before learning (planning), help seeking, and
   persistence. Intervention compliance was however low. Further analyses
   exploring potential causes of the low intervention compliance were
   conducted. The great majority of learners who did not comply with the
   intervention dropped out of the MOOC before they encountered the
   implemented intervention. We conclude that the SRL intervention has been
   successful in supporting both learners' SRL as well as their course
   completion. Implications include the importance of supporting learners'
   SRL as well as the necessity to conduct further research on how to
   improve intervention compliance.},

Abstract = {English is the most used second language in the world. Mastering
   vocabulary is the prerequisite for learning English well. In middle
   school, students direct their own studying outside the classroom to
   facilitate memorizing and understanding. However, the lack of teacher
   guidance in the self-study process will negatively affect learning.
   Producing video lecture materials including talking teachers costs time,
   energy, and money. The development of artificial intelligence makes it
   possible to create such materials automatically. However, it is still
   unclear whether a system embedded with AI-generated virtual teachers can
   facilitate self-study compared with the system with merely the speech in
   self-study in K12. To address this gap, we conducted a user study with
   56 high school students, collecting learning outcomes, user experience,
   and learning experience. Results showed that the virtual teacher helps
   to improve the student's English learning performance both in retention
   and transfer. Participants reported high user and learning experience.
   Our findings shed light on the use of virtual teachers for self-study
   students in K12.},

Abstract = {ObjectiveTo compare the effectiveness of technology-enhanced learning
   (TEL) with traditional learning in prosthodontic education.MethodsThe
   protocol was registered before commencement {[}CRD42023390277]. The
   search was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
   focused on comparative assessment of TEL and traditional learning in
   prosthodontic education up to 6 June 2024. A comprehensive search
   strategy was formulated, encompassing multiple electronic databases.
   Screening, data extraction and risk of bias assessment using the
   Cochrane tool (RoB 2) were performed. Educational outcomes were
   evaluated by Kirkpatrick's four-level evaluation model.ResultsOf 2830
   records identified, 14 RCTs were included. All the trials were judged at
   high risk of bias or had some concerns. The included studies assessed
   the short-term benefits of various TEL approaches, including e-learning,
   blended learning, video demonstration specialized self-evaluation
   software and virtual reality simulation in prosthodontic education for
   undergraduates. Promising results were found in individual studies,
   particularly in terms of perceived learning conditions with
   problem-based learning (PBL) and self-reported understanding and
   confidence when using video demonstrations. Most studies reported
   comparable outcomes to traditional learning in practical skills
   assessments, while the results regarding the acquisition of theoretical
   knowledge through the incorporation of TEL approaches were
   contradictory. One study reported promising results in perceived
   learning conditions with the PBL approach, as well as improved

Abstract = {Although many studies in physical education and in gymnastics have
   revealed the positive impact of video feedback on students' motivation,
   no study has considered the effects of video feedback use on students'
   situational interest (SI). However, SI is typically viewed as a powerful
   motivator for students when they are engaged in a specific activity such
   as analysing video feedback. Thus, the purpose of this study was to
   compare the effects of video feedback use on students' SI. Participants
   were 361 secondary school students who practised technical skills in
   gymnastics. They were assigned to three groups comparing various
   conditions of video feedback. They responded to the French 19-item SI
   scale after practising the learning tasks. A multivariate analysis of
   variance was used to compare SI scores between the three groups. The
   results revealed the critical role physical education teachers play when
   using video feedback to enhance SI in gymnastics lessons.},

Abstract = {We study self-supervised video representation learning, which is a
   challenging task due to 1) lack of labels for explicit supervision; 2)
   unstructured and noisy visual information. Existing methods mainly use
   contrastive loss with video clips as the instances and learn visual
   representation by discriminating instances from each other, but they
   need a careful treatment of negative pairs by either relying on large
   batch sizes, memory banks, extra modalities or customized mining
   strategies, which inevitably includes noisy data. In this paper, we
   observe that the consistency between positive samples is the key to
   learn robust video representation. Specifically, we propose two tasks to
   learn appearance and speed consistency, respectively. The appearance
   consistency task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips of
   the same video with different playback speeds. The speed consistency
   task aims to maximize the similarity between two clips with the same
   playback speed but different appearance information. We show that
   optimizing the two tasks jointly consistently improves the performance
   on downstream tasks, e.g., action recognition and video retrieval.
   Remarkably, for action recognition on the UCF-101 dataset, we achieve
   90.8\% accuracy without using any extra modalities or negative pairs for
   unsupervised pretraining, which outperforms the ImageNet supervised
   pretrained model. Codes and models will be available.},

   Within Pre-clinical Microanatomy and Medical Physiology Teaching},

Abstract = {Modern medical curricula adopt the use self-directed learning
   approaches, which frequently include the use of technology enhanced
   learning resources. Often, students prefer those which are available via
   mobile devices because it can facilitate flexibility and autonomy with
   their learning, more so than with traditional modalities. Although the
   production value of resources may be appealing to users, those that work
   most effectively for education align well to existing pedagogies. One
   such pedagogy is the cognitive theory of multimedia learning. It is a
   framework that can be used to facilitate the construction of educational
   video, that can benefit learning gain through reducing the cognitive
   load.
   Although much research has been conducted on how information should be
   presented in video resources, there is very limited evidence within the
   subject of clinical anatomy and physiology or when applying different
   types of educational video, such as screencasts, or interactive video.
   In the field of anatomy education recent approaches have sought to
   standardize a robust methodology to evaluate digital resources. This
   procedure utilizes a combination of normalized learning gain and learner
   perceptions to gain an accurate picture of educational impact.
   The current study investigated the impact of both interactive
   educational videos and screencasts compared with traditional teaching
   techniques in the challenging subjects of histology and pain physiology.
   A quasi-randomized, cross-sectional study was conducted with 135 medical
   students enrolled at the University of Southampton. Sixty fourth- and
   fifth-year students assessed the histology resources, and 75 second-year
   students assessed the pain histology resources. Participants were
   randomly assigned to either a text-based resource, interactive video, or
   screencast group. Outcomes measured were:
   1. Normalized knowledge gain (and retention) assessed using
   one-best-answer multiple choice question tests
   2. Student perceptions using 1-10 Likert-scale style questionnaires.
   A significant improvement in mean normalized knowledge gain was observed
   for all teaching modalities. For pain physiology, the means were:
   Text-49.0\% (n = 23), interactive video-70.1\% (n = 26), and
   screencast-53.8\% (n = 26). For all learning gains, P < 0.001. For
   histology, there was a mean normalized learning gain for text-80.0\% (n
   = 20), interactive video-74.4\% (n = 20), and screencast groups-68.3\%
   (n = 20). For all learning gains, P < 0.001. For pain physiology
   resources, interactive videos significantly improved learning gain
   compared to the screencast (P < 0.05) and the text resource groups (P <
   0.01). There was no significant difference between those who used the
   text or screencast resources. There was also no significant difference
   in knowledge retention between the different teaching methods for each
   subject.
   Following teaching, all three teaching modalities had similar effects on
   student confidence in the subjects, desire for educational channels
   dedicated to each topic, and preference for locally produced vs.
   externally produced videos. These findings have the potential to inform
   educators on which types of resources to create or to select for their
   students to have the best impact on learning.},

Abstract = {The Postgraduate Medical Education Office (PGME) Core Curriculum Web
   Initiative - called PGCorEd (TM) was implemented in 2008 as a required
   foundational curriculum for all 1st and 2nd year resident physicians.
   This new curriculum was accelerated by new accreditation standards for
   residency training programs by the Royal College of Physicians and
   Surgeons of Canada in 2006. PGCorEd (TM) modules are web-based and
   interactive in nature, integrating several simulation approaches to
   learning and evaluation including: video for role model simulations,
   video narratives, content interactivity techniques, and electronic key
   feature case assessments. This paper reports on a case study in a
   multi-method curriculum project that included: action research,
   deliberative curriculum inquiry, development of a standardized online
   multimedia based curriculum, simulation approaches, learner assessment
   including pre module and post module testing of learners, a
   comprehensive program evaluation involving pilot testing of content, and
   the collection of learner satisfaction data. The results from the pilot
   testing and 2 years of data on pre module and post module testing of
   learners reveal that this fully online self-moderated curriculum is a
   viable forum for teaching learners in busy field-based training
   environments. Learner satisfaction surveys for the completed modules
   show that using multimedia and storytelling are effective approaches to
   teaching and learner engagement in an online environment. Additionally,
   the findings reveal a positive impact on learning and utility to medical
   residents across diverse training programs. This paper also illustrates
   some practices to integrate simulation in the effective learning and
   teaching of the foundational humanistic competencies for postgraduate
   medical residents. Deliberative efforts by the design teams to be
   attentive to the needs of learners, including the active participation
   of learners in constructing the simulations, has resulted in an
   authenticity of the simulations noted by learners and faculty involved
   with this project.},

Title = {Supporting self-regulated-learning in colonoscopy training-A comparison
   cohort trial},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},

Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Aim: This study aimed to demonstrate that using a self -regulated
   learning (SRL) approach can improve colonoscopy performance skills.
   Background: Colonoscopy is the gold standard for detecting colorectal
   cancer and removing its precursors: polyps. Acquiring proficiency in
   colonoscopy is challenging, requiring completion of several hundred
   procedures. SRL seems to be beneficial to help trainees acquire
   competencies in regulating their future learning processes and enhance
   the outcomes of current learning situations. SRL is a learner -centred
   approach that refers to a trainee `s ability to understand and control
   their learning environment, including cognitions, motivations and
   emotions. The key abilities include self- and situational awareness,
   task analysis, and strategic planning. This study is the first to use an
   SRL approach for workplace -based colonoscopy training. Methods: In this
   comparison cohort trial, participants used two SRL supports: a self
   -review of videotaped performance, and an online learning platform with
   procedural and conceptual knowledge about colonoscopy. In the control
   cohort, participants performed patient -based colonoscopy as usual in
   their departments. Improvement was monitored via three video -based
   ratings (study start, end of the study period, and follow-up) using the
   Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Competency Assessment Tool (GiECAT). Outcomes
   were analysed using two-way analysis of variance with repeated
   measurements. Results: This study recruited 21 participants (12,
   intervention cohort; nine, control cohort); 58 videos were recorded. The
   intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.88 (95\% CI 0.61 -0.98; p <
   0.001). The global rating scale (GRS) and checklist (CL) in GiECAT were
   analysed separately. No statistically significant main effects of cohort
   (GRS: F(1,16) = 2.84, p = 0.11; CL: F(1,16) = 1.06, p = 0.32), test
   (GRS: F(2,32) = 2.56, p = 0.09; CL: F(2,32) = 0.76, p = 0.48), or
   interactions between cohort and test were observed (GRS: F(2,32) = 1.16,
   p = 0.33; CL: F(2,32) = 1.01, p = 0.37). Conclusions: SRL in patient
   -based colonoscopy is feasible; however, no clear effect on performance
   scores was observed.},

Title = {Exploring sequences of learner activities in relation to self-regulated
   learning in a massive open online course},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {140},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) refers to how learners steer their own
   learning. Supporting SRL has been shown to enhance the use of SRL
   strategies and learning performance in computer-based learning
   environments. However, little is known about supporting SRL in Massive
   Open Online Courses (MOOCs). In this study, weekly SRL prompts were
   embedded as videos in a MOOC. We employed a sequential pattern mining
   algorithm, Sequential Pattern Discovery using Equivalence classes
   (cSPADE), on gathered log data to explore whether differences exist
   between learners who viewed the SRL-prompt videos and those who did not.
   Results showed that SRL-prompt viewers interacted with more course
   activities and completed these activities in a more similar sequential
   pattern than non SRL-prompt viewers. Also, SRL-prompt viewers tended to
   follow the course structure, which has been identified as a behavioral
   characteristic of students who scored higher on SRL (i.e., comprehensive
   learners) in previous research. Based on the results, implications for
   supporting SRL in MOOCs are discussed.},

Abstract = {The current study aimed to examine the relationships between dimensions
   of parental scaffolding and children's self-regulated learning (SRL).
   One hundred and thirty Chinese kindergarten children participated in a
   range of problem-solving tasks with their parents and independently.
   Parent-child interactions and child-alone behaviours were video-recorded
   for an in-depth observational analysis. Parental cognitive support,
   emotional support, and contingency were coded in parent-child
   interactions. Children's cognitive, metacognitive, and motivational
   strategic behaviours and task performance were coded and assessed within
   the context of child-alone tasks. Results showed that contingency was
   particularly important for children's SRL. Parental contingency was the
   only independent predictor of children's SRL among the three aspects of
   parental scaffolding and mediated the effect of parent education levels
   on children's SRL. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {This study explores the use of open educational resources (OERs) in
   studio-based learning and their influence on learning experiences. The
   research team conducted action research with 30 bachelor of arts
   students who were completing a video production subject. Students were
   required to learn from a website containing open online learning
   resources under a flipped classroom approach. A teaching schedule and
   website were designed according to several criteria. Research data were
   collected through observation, reflective journals, and interviews and
   were analyzed via thematic analysis. Participating students expressed
   their perceptions of benefits and hesitation in utilizing OERs in
   learning. They agreed that the use of OERs as flipped classroom learning
   materials could positively affect their learning, primarily through
   competence and learning autonomy as indicated in self-determination
   theory. This investigation provides teachers with valuable experience
   and suggestions for teaching and learning approaches that incorporate
   OERs into studio-based education. Students learn from OERs in which they
   can gain the most up-to-date technical knowledge in an autonomous
   environment. This experience indicates that this pedagogy greatly and
   positively influences students' subject-learning experiences, learning
   outcomes, and self-learning skills.},

Title = {Investigating Flipped Learning: Student Self-Regulated Learning,

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SCIENCE EDUCATION AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {26},

Abstract = {In flipped classrooms, lectures, which are normally delivered in-class,
   are assigned as homework in the form of videos, and assignments that
   were traditionally assigned as homework, are done as learning activities
   in class. It was hypothesized that the effectiveness of the flipped
   model hinges on a student's desire and ability to adopt a self-directed
   learning style. The purpose of this study was twofold; it aimed at
   examining the relationship between two variables-students' perceptions
   of the flipped model and their self-regulated learning (SRL)
   behaviors-and the impact that these variables have on achievement in a
   flipped class. For the study, 76 participants from a flipped
   introductory biology course were asked about their SRL strategy use and
   perceptions of the flipped model. SRL strategy use was measured using a
   modified version of the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire
   (MSLQ; Wolters et al. 2005), while the flipped perceptions survey was
   newly derived. Student letter grades were collected as a measure of
   achievement. Through regression analysis, it was found that students'
   perceptions of the flipped model positively predict students' use of
   several types of SRL strategies. However, the data did not indicate a
   relationship between student perceptions and achievement, neither
   directly nor indirectly, through SRL strategy use. Results suggest that
   flipped classrooms demonstrate their successes in the active learning
   sessions through constructivist teaching methods. Video lectures hold an
   important role in flipped classes, however, students may need to
   practice SRL skills to become more self-directed and effectively learn
   from them.},

Abstract = {Innovative learning activities, based on constructivism, were applied in
   the courses for students of Computer science, future CS teachers, at the
   Faculty of Education. We observed students' learning behaviour as well
   as their actions, preferences, and learning patterns in different stages
   of learning process, supported by the e-portfolios and different
   e-learning environments. We tried to establish comprehensive environment
   for students' self assessment through self reflection and critical
   thinking. Students engaged in all these activities had an opportunity to
   develop competences for project and team work through collaborative
   learning. Active and collaborative forms of learning were used to
   facilitate higher order thinking skills and to develop assessment
   skills. To achieve this, students designed and developed their own
   e-portfolios and blended learning environments. Autonomous learning and
   critical thinking was supported by creating multimedia, audio-video
   content and interactive activities, explorative learning, discovery
   learning, reflections, self-reflections, and creation of exercises for
   knowledge assessment. Students work either in small groups or
   individually, where they are supposed to collaborate with their
   colleges, to gain some feedback of their work to improve their own
   knowledge.},

Abstract = {Learning how to develop lesson and unit plans is recognised as a
   priority for teacher education programmes; however, recent empirical
   research on planning is scarce, particularly in physical education. The
   purpose of this research was to analyse how and why we teach physical
   education pre-service teachers (PSTs) to plan in the ways we do. A
   secondary purpose was to consider alternative approaches to teaching
   about planning based on this analysis. Over one academic term, we used
   collaborative self-study of teacher education practice methodology and
   gathered several forms of qualitative data, including reflective journal
   entries, recorded video conversations, and teaching artefacts. Through
   sharing and interrogating our assumptions about the nature of planning
   and how to teach PSTs about planning, we came to see several flaws in
   the approaches we had typically used, particularly in terms of the
   emphasis given to the products (i.e. developing and submitting complete
   lesson plans) over the processes of planning, and how this emphasis did
   not necessarily support PSTs' learning. This was partially because we
   found it challenging to model our processes of planning for PSTs in
   authentic ways. We agree that planning is and should be a central part
   of learning to teach; however, this research suggests that the `typical'
   actions in how we teach PSTs about planning may be ripe for disruption
   and redesign. This research provides a rationale for a better balance to
   be struck between teaching about planning-as-process and teaching about
   planning-as-product.},

Abstract = {Education is a complex system that requires multiple perspectives and
   levels of analysis to understand its contexts, dynamics, and actors'
   interactions, particularly concerning technological innovations. This
   paper aims to identify some of the most promising trends in blended
   learning implementations in higher education, the capabilities provided
   by the technology (e.g., datafication), and the contexts of use of these
   capabilities. This literature review selected and analyzed forty-five
   peer-reviewed journal articles. The findings highlight some common
   capabilities among digital educational technologies. In particular,
   digital tools or platforms with human-to-machine interaction
   capabilities may enhance automated processes for blended learning
   delivery modes. In this context, digital technologies such as video
   capsules and intelligent tutoring systems may improve learning-teaching
   activities. First, by providing access to more students and facilitating
   self-paced online learning activities. Second, by offering an individual
   path of learning for each student, thus improving out-of-class
   activities and feedback. Educational technology capabilities (ETC)
   provide complementary insights to identify the best approach when
   aligning learning goals in technology-based implementations. Further
   research will be required to empirically validate these results.},

Abstract = {Traditionally, Spanish university teaching has been characterized by a
   strong theoretical charge with small emphasis on practical application.
   The implementation of the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) tried to
   change this trend focusing on the attention of the figure of the
   student, limiting the figure of the teacher as ``a shepherd who leads
   his flock.{''} Within this scenario, this paper presents a website
   offering to students, and university community in general, the chance to
   enter into the analysis of an econometric model in an independent way.
   The produced material is basically made up of videos together with
   appropriate explanatory comments that show how to estimate and validate
   a general linear model by using specialized econometric software. The
   election of the econometric packages Gretl and R is not arbitrary but
   responds to the need to provide to students reliable tools that may be
   freely used in their professional future without being subject to
   licensing fees. The main goal is to focus on the learning process in the
   students providing them more than only pages filled with formulas (often
   incomprehensible to the student). We consider that this contribution
   leads to a learning methodology based on the student, combining
   education, research and innovation while improving the employability of
   our students, being some of the main priorities of the EHEA.},

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is critical to students' academic success
   and lifelong learning. Although the benefits of SRL have been examined
   in many studies, few have explored it in a broader educational context.
   This study presents an eight-month institutional case study that
   demonstrates how SRL has been developed as a pedagogy through the
   collective endeavours of teachers, researchers, and experts at a
   university in Hong Kong. A case study method protocol was followed. Data
   were obtained from multiple sources, including surveys of teachers (N =
   93) and students (N = 215), interviews with teachers (n = 5) and
   students (n = 19), archived course documents, videos, and project
   reports. T-tests, coding, and document analysis were applied to analyse
   the collected data. The results showed that the teachers had good
   knowledge of SRL strategies but some students struggled to apply them
   effectively. Our study's findings have various implications for the
   effective promotion of SRL at the university level, and include the
   importance of developing a collective approach involving various members
   of the university, integrating responsive pedagogy, and adapting SRL
   strategies to students' individual needs. Future research can follow our
   methodology to replicate the study in different educational contexts.},

Abstract = {This self-study of teacher education practices examines the processes of
   developing a pedagogy of teacher education. Drawing on multiple data
   sources (video and audio, reflective diary, and focus groups), we used
   concepts from rhizomatics to explore the question, ``How does a teacher
   educator negotiate his learning and practice as he develops a pedagogy
   of teacher education?{''} We explicate the complexity of teacher
   education learning by showing how a conflux of interactive elements
   co-produce a teacher educator's practice. This encourages us to
   introduce the metaphor of ``orchestration{''} as a way of
   conceptualizing teacher educator practice and pedagogy. (C) 2019 The

Abstract = {Fostering students' abilities to deal with practical problems is an
   important objective of professional training. To enable students to have
   more practicing time under the supervision of trainers in class, flipped
   learning has been adopted to shift the lecture time to the before-class
   stage, and hence more time is available for in-class practicing.
   Although flipped learning has been recognized by scholars as an
   effective teaching mode, researchers have also indicated the challenges
   of implementing it; in particular, many students have difficulty
   learning before the class on their own. In this research, a
   self-regulated flipped learning approach was proposed to cope with this
   problem by guiding students to set their learning goals, and supporting
   them in monitoring their learning status in five stages, namely, goal
   setting, flipped learning (including pre-class video-based instruction
   and in-class discussion), task sharing, self-evaluation, and
   self-regulation feedback. In addition, an experiment was conducted in a
   professional training program to examine the effectiveness of the
   proposed approach. From the experimental results, it was found that the
   approach significantly improved the students' learning achievement,
   self-efficacy, self-regulation, and critical thinking, which could be a
   good reference for future research related to flipped professional
   training.},

Volume = {34},

Abstract = {Background/objective: Persons with chronic spinal cord injury (SCI) have
   a high lifetime need for ongoing patient education to reduce the risk of
   serious and costly medical conditions. We have addressed this need
   through monthly in-person public education programs called SCI Forums.
   More recently, we began videotaping these programs for streaming on our
   website to reach a geographically diverse audience of patients,
   caregivers, and providers.
   Design/methods: We compared information from the in-person forums to
   that of the same forums shown streaming on our website during a 1-year
   period.
   Results: Both the in-person and Internet versions of the forums received
   high overall ratings from individuals who completed evaluation forms.
   Eighty-eight percent of online evaluators and 96\% of in-person
   evaluators reported that they gained new information from the forum; 52
   and 64\% said they changed their attitude, and 61 and 68\% said they
   would probably change their behavior or take some kind of action based
   on information they learned. Ninety-one percent of online evaluators
   reported that video is better than text for presenting this kind of
   information.
   Conclusion: Online video is an accessible, effective, and well-accepted
   way to present ongoing SCI education and can reach a wider geographical
   audience than in-person presentations.},

Abstract = {With the rapid development of the Internet, online learning has become
   one of the main ways of acquiring knowledge. In order to make teachers
   understand students' emotional states and adjust teaching programs on
   time, a new video based model called the Wild Facial Spatiotemporal
   Network (WFSTN) is proposed in this paper for emotion recognition in
   online learning environments. The model consists of two modules: a
   pretrained DenseNet121 for extracting facial spatial features, and a
   Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network with
   self-attention for generating attentional hidden states. In addition, a
   dataset of student emotions in online learning environments (DSEOLE) is
   produced using a self-developed online educational aid system. The
   method is evaluated on the Acted Facial Expressions in the Wild (AFEW)
   and DSEOLE datasets, achieving 72.76\% and 73.67\% accuracy in
   three-class classification, respectively. The results show that the
   proposed method outperforms many existing works on emotion recognition
   for online education.},

Abstract = {Popularity of videos for classroom instruction has increased over the
   years due to affordability and user-friendliness of today's digital
   video cameras. This prevalence has led to an increase in flipped, K-12
   classrooms countrywide. However, quantitative data establishing the
   appropriate video length to foster authentic learning is limited,
   particularly in middle-level classrooms. We focus on this aspect of
   video technology in two flipped science classrooms at the middle school
   level to determine the optimal video length to enable learning, increase
   retention and support student motivation. Our results indicate that
   while assessments directly following short videos were slightly higher,
   these findings were not significantly different from scores following
   longer videos. While short-term retention of material did not seem to be
   influenced by video length, longer-term retention for males and students
   with learning disabilities was higher following short videos compared to
   long as assessed on summative assessments. Students self-report that
   they were more engaged, had enhanced focus, and had a perceived higher
   retention of content following shorter videos. This study has important
   implications for student learning, application of content, and the
   development of critical thinking skills. This is particularly paramount
   in an era where content knowledge is just a search engine away.},

Abstract = {To develop competence through e-learning tools, students must be
   motivated to use these tools. Hence, we conducted two empirical studies
   to explore the motivating potential of an adaptive video role playing
   game (AVR) for training communication competencies. In Study 1 (N = 54),
   we used a withinperson design to examine students' motivation in three
   learning conditions: in the classroom, when playing the AVR, and when
   doing homework. The results showed that, relative to the homework
   condition, in the AVR condition students were higher in perceived
   competence, relatedness, intrinsic motivation, and flow. No difference
   between the classroom condition and the AVR condition were found. In
   Study 2 (N = 150), we used a randomized experimental design to examine
   the motivational consequences of using videos (AVR) rather than photos
   (APR) in the adaptive role playing game. We found that, relative to
   students in the APR condition, students in the AVR condition were higher
   in relatedness and flow. No differences in perceived competence,
   autonomy, and intrinsic motivation were observed. We conclude that an
   AVR may have considerable motivational benefits relative to common
   homework assignments, and some motivational benefits relative to an APR.},

Abstract = {Background: The learning and demonstration of a clinical procedure is a
   fundamental aspect of any nursing program. One common invasive clinical
   procedure is peripheral intravenous cannulation. Aim: This study aimed
   to evaluate an innovative teaching approach of self-evaluating
   video-recorded performance for final year undergraduate nursing
   students. Methods: Guided by Ericsson's deliberate practice theory, a
   single-center, nonblinded, 2-group, mixed method randomized control
   trial was designed to provide students with more simulated practice
   opportunities. Results: There was no significant difference in average
   knowledge, performance and attitude scores between the control and
   intervention groups at follow-up. However, both control and experimental
   group separately, improved significantly in their average knowledge,
   performance, and attitude scores from baseline to followup. Qualitative
   responses were positive from students regarding additional practice
   sessions and the intervention. Conclusions: The findings of this study
   demonstrate that more simulated practice sessions and self-evaluating
   video-recorded performance are promising teaching strategies that can be
   implemented to improve educational outcomes and to increase students'
   satisfaction with their learning. (c) 2024 The Authors. Published by

Abstract = {Many curricula that have been developed in higher education can be
   considered as digitized books, but many of them have been evolved as
   e-learning materials - with videos, animations and activities. Teachers
   introduce these materials into their courses. The blended learning form
   is one of the most popular learning methods among students and teachers,
   too. Students should use the developed learning materials effectively.
   The teacher's experiences show in many times that the electronic
   curricula developed by the teachers are not as efficient as teachers
   suspect.
   In this paper we examine the gap between the skills that electronic
   materials require and the students' knowledge on the field of using
   electronic learning materials in higher education. We show the result of
   a survey on the competences on using electronic material, on the
   affinities of using information technology among the first-year students
   before they start their study at our university. The self-report
   questionnaire was filled by four thousand six hundred students before
   they began the studies at University of Debrecen. We got and processed
   data from all fifteen faculties. Based on the results we can conclude
   that higher education should pay attention to developing competences and
   skills on computer science for their first-year students if they want
   the electronic materials to be efficient.},

Abstract = {Decision making in many industries today is being improved drastically
   thanks to artificial intelligence and deep learning. New algorithms
   address challenges such as genome mapping, medical diagnostics,
   self-driving cars, autonomous robots and more. Deep learning in embedded
   systems requires high optimization due to the high computational demand,
   given that power, heat dissipation, size and price constraints are
   numerous. In this paper we analyze several acceleration methods which
   include utilization of GPUs for most complex variants of deep learning,
   such as semantic video segmentation operating in real time.
   Specifically, we propose mapping of acceleration routines commonly
   present within deep learning SDKs to different network layers in
   semantic segmentation. Finally, we evaluate one implementation utilizing
   the enumerated techniques for semantic segmentation of front camera in

Abstract = {In recent years, a variety of emerging online media, such as TikTok,
   Kuaishou, YouTube and other short video application platforms, have
   appeared. The problem of short video addiction has become an issue to
   education experts and the general public, as students' excessive use of
   short video has become increasingly serious with many hidden concerns to
   the students' learning effectiveness. In addition, to meet the growing
   demand for innovative design talents worldwide, the Taiwan government
   has been committed to promoting policies related to the cultivation of
   innovative and creative talents nowadays, particularly for innovative
   design profession students who often use the Internet and short videos
   for learning. Therefore, the study aims to use questionnaires to
   understand the habits and addiction of the innovative design profession
   students in using short videos, and to further investigate the relation
   of short video addiction to the students' creative self-efficacy (CSE)
   and career interests. A total of 561 valid questionnaires were collected
   after eliminating invalid questionnaires and reliability analysis.
   Structural equation modeling and model validation were conducted
   afterwards. The results showed that short video addiction had a negative
   effect on CSE; CSE had a positive effect on career interests; and CSE
   had an indirect effect between short video addiction and career
   interests.},

Title = {How can signaling in authentic classroom videos support reasoning on how
   to induce learning strategies?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Month = {JAN 20},
Abstract = {Classroom videos are a viable means to implement evidence-informed
   reasoning in teacher education in order to establish an
   evidence-informed teaching practice. Although learning with videos
   relieves pre-service teachers from acting in parallel and might reduce
   complexity, the material still poses higher cognitive load than written
   text vignettes or other traditionally used static material. In
   particular, the information they deliver is transient and can,
   therefore, easily be missed. Signaling can guide learners' attention to
   central aspects of a video, thereby reducing cognitive load and
   enhancing learning outcomes. In the current project, pre-service
   teachers acquired scientific knowledge about learning strategies and
   their promotion in a computer-based learning environment. We explored
   the effect of different arrangements of signaling in classroom
   video-examples on conceptual knowledge and the reasoning-component of
   professional vision. Therefore, we conducted a set of two studies with
   100 student teachers including two signal arrangements in order to
   investigate how signaling can help learning to reason about classroom
   videos. In addition, we varied if participants received information on
   the use of signals in advance (informed) or not (uninformed). We
   measured conceptual knowledge by asking participants what they knew
   about self-regulation strategies. Additionally, we assessed reasoning by
   asking participants to notice sequences in a video where teachers
   induced learning strategies, and to reason in what respect the observed
   behavior was useful to induce the strategy. Uninformed signaling did not
   affect the acquisition of conceptual knowledge and reasoning. Informed
   signaling led to significantly better conceptual knowledge than
   uninformed signaling. It is argued that the signal-induced extraneous
   load exceeded the load reduction due to the signal's selection advantage
   in the uninformed conditions. In a third, exploratory study, nine
   participants were interviewed on the perception of different signals and
   indicated that spotlight and zoom-in signals foster processing of
   classroom videos.},

Title = {Effect of active learning and online discussions on the academic
   performances of dental students},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {Background COVID-19 caused significant confusion around the world, and
   dental education was no exception. Therefore, in line with the demands
   of the times, this study sought to determine the applicability of online
   active learning to dental education. Methods This study was conducted in
   the second semester of 2020 at a school of dentistry in a selective
   university in Korea. A total of 114 dental students were recruited.
   Participants were assigned to four different groups (lecture and
   discussion {[}LD], lecture and discussion with instructor's worksheet
   {[}LW], self-study and discussion {[}SSD], and self-study and discussion
   with instructor's worksheet {[}SW]) using the random breakout room
   function in the Zoom video conference application. Their final test
   scores were then analyzed using analysis of variance and the online
   active learning results were compared with the offline learning results.
   Results The scores were highest for the transfer type items in the SSD
   group, followed by the SW group and the two lecture groups, which had no
   significant differences. These scores and pattern differences between
   the groups were similar for all items. The results suggested that
   studying by oneself rather than simply listening to lectures enhanced
   the effects of the discussions and led to higher learning outcomes. In
   addition, the effect of the instructor's intervention in the middle of
   the discussion varied depending on the pre-learning activities of
   discussion. As with previous offline experiments, self-study followed by
   group discussion had higher learning outcomes for both the verbatim and
   transfer type items. Conclusions In agreement with the Interactive,
   Constructive, Active, and Passive (ICAP) framework and other active
   learning theories, the findings clearly indicated that online active
   learning was applicable to dental students, and when self-study precedes
   discussion, the learning is richer and the learning outcomes are better.},

Title = {Transforming traditional physiotherapy hands-on skills teaching into
   video-based learning},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Background Pandemic-induced restrictions forced curriculum
   transformation from on-site education to virtual learning options. This
   report describes this transition, the challenge of creating
   technology-enhanced learning for hands-on psychomotor skills teaching in
   physiotherapy, and students' evaluations of the new technology-enhanced
   learning approach in Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy.
   Methods On-site theoretical background lectures were replaced with
   e-learning sessions. Faculty hands- on skills demonstrations for the
   entire class were replaced with video-recorded demonstrations. Videos
   included verbal and written instructions and were complemented with
   checklists guiding the students, training in pairs, through their
   learning tasks. A cross-sectional observational survey for teaching
   quality evaluated this new technology-enhanced learning approach and
   assessed students' preference for traditional or video-based hands- on
   skills learning.
   Results Survey return rate was > 50\% (46 participating students).
   Teaching quality was rated between 1.5 +/- 0.5 and 1.8 +/- 0.4 (Likert
   scale from - 2 to + 2). Most students (66.7\%) preferred the new
   approach. They appreciated for example that videos were available all
   the time, enabling self-paced learning, providing an equally good view
   on skills demonstrations, and the convenience to be able to rewind,
   re-view, and use speed adjustment options.
   Conclusions Students preferred the new video-based learning of skills
   for Complex Decongestive Physiotherapy. Because in-class live skills
   demonstrations were omitted, faculty had more time to provide individual
   feedback and answer questions. The shift from teacher- to
   student-centered learning enabled students to control their own learning
   pace. The innovative program was maintained after pandemic-induced
   restrictions were lifted. The success of this approach should be tested
   in other physiotherapy settings and different educational institutions.},

Abstract = {It was investigated whether teachers' feedback skills to support
   students' self-regulated learning (SRL) can be improved by short-term
   video-based interventions and/or direct instructions that were adapted
   to a SRL framework. Forty pre-service and 40 in-service teachers were

   Highest improvements were expected for the combination of the two

   support SRL benefited most from instruction-only, while the reduction of
   dysfunctional feedback was highest in the video + instruction condition.
   The findings have practical implications for the design of interventions

Title = {Animating Landscape: Self-Supervised Learning of Decoupled Motion and
   Appearance for Single-Image Video Synthesis},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON GRAPHICS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {38},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Automatic generation of a high-quality video from a single image remains
   a challenging task despite the recent advances in deep generative
   models. This paper proposes a method that can create a high-resolution,
   long-term animation using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) from a
   single landscape image where we mainly focus on skies and waters. Our
   key observation is that the motion (e.g., moving clouds) and appearance
   (e.g., time-varying colors in the sky) in natural scenes have different
   time scales. We thus learn them separately and predict them with
   decoupled control while handling future uncertainty in both predictions
   by introducing latent codes. Unlike previous methods that infer output
   frames directly, our CNNs predict spatially-smooth intermediate data,
   i.e., for motion, flow fields for warping, and for appearance, color
   transfer maps, via self-supervised learning, i.e., without
   explicitly-provided ground truth. These intermediate data are applied
   not to each previous output frame, but to the input image only once for
   each output frame. This design is crucial to alleviate error
   accumulation in long-term predictions, which is the essential problem in
   previous recurrent approaches. The output frames can be looped like
   cinemagraph, and also be controlled directly by specifying latent codes
   or indirectly via visual annotations. We demonstrate the effectiveness
   of our method through comparisons with the state-of-the-arts on video
   prediction as well as appearance manipulation. Resultant videos, codes,
   and datasets will be available at

Title = {Embedded Questions and Targeted Feedback Transform Passive Educational
   Videos into Effective Active Learning Tools},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Month = {2022 JUN 21},
Abstract = {Question-embedded videos (QEVs) are learning tools that require students
   to solve problems and receive immediate targeted feedback while
   progressing through the video. As an effective learning modality, QEVs
   may be deployed for the preclass preparation phase of flipped
   classrooms. As flipped classrooms become more popular in STEM courses,
   effective out-of-class preparation is essential to maximize student
   learning. While previous studies have compared learning gains from
   textbooks and QEVs, this study compares two different types of videos:
   traditional (narrative) videos and question-embedded videos. Traditional
   assignments such as narrative videos primarily consist of content
   delivery, whereas question-embedded videos integrate active
   problem-solving and are an effective tool in increasing student
   engagement. This communication discusses separate studies comparing
   learning gains from narrative videos and question-embedded videos for
   problem-solving in two STEM disciplines: organic chemistry and
   introductory physics. Students learning from question-embedded videos
   significantly outperformed students learning from narrative videos.
   These results suggest that assigning passive narrative videos is not
   sufficient to yield maximum learning gains for students; rather,
   assigning out-of-class work with QEVs leads to substantially greater
   learning gains because of enforced active problem-solving paired with
   immediate feedback.},

Abstract = {This study examined the final grade and satisfaction level differences
   among students taking specific courses using three different methods:
   face-to-face in class, via satellite broadcasting at remote sites, and
   via live video-streaming at home or at work. In each case, the same
   course was taught by the same instructor in all three delivery methods,
   and an attempt was made to survey students taking the course via the
   three different delivery methods. MANOVA results indicated no grade or
   satisfaction level differences among the three populations.
   Self-reported computer literacy skills revealed a slight fit between the
   chosen delivery mode and the reported computer literacy skills. These
   results provide additional evidence to support both the ``no significant
   difference{''} phenomenon and the use of distance education as a viable,
   convenient and flexible alternative delivery mode capable of extending
   learning opportunities to non-traditional students. Published by

Abstract = {The purpose of the present study was to examine if and how the
   introduction of a flipped learning (FL) framework in Norwegian lower and

   Norwegian students (48\% girls) from secondary and upper secondary

   group, with the intervention aimed at integrating information
   communication technology (ICT) through the use of online videos. The
   results showed a negative motivational change for male students unless
   the activity changes were placed within an explanatory rationale through
   FL. The application of FL caused more cognitive knowledge learning,
   resulting in higher levels of HRFK among both girls and boys. The
   current research provided valuable insights into Norwegian students'
   motivation for PE and that cognitive knowledge learning can be affected
   when integrating the use of ICT in PE.},

   on the human kidney consisting of explanations and drawings. After each
   part, students typed an explanation without access to information from
   the video (explain group) or with access to the visualizations from the
   video (explain-visuals group), or they studied the visualizations and
   transcript from the video (restudy group). Students who explained
   significantly outperformed the restudy group on the transfer test (d =
   .47). The explain-visuals group generated significantly more
   comprehensive explanations during learning than the explain group (d =
   .54), but this did not result in significantly better performance on the
   subsequent transfer test (d = .09), suggesting the visuals may have
   served as a crutch more than a scaffold.},

Abstract = {Purpose of reviewThe notion that play may facilitate learning has long
   been touted. Here, we review how video game play may be leveraged for
   enhancing attentional control, allowing greater cognitive flexibility
   and learning and in turn new routes to better address developmental
   disorders.Recent findingsVideo games, initially developed for
   entertainment, appear to enhance the behavior in domains as varied as
   perception, attention, task switching, or mental rotation. This
   surprisingly wide transfer may be mediated by enhanced attentional
   control, allowing increased signal-to-noise ratio and thus more informed
   decisions.SummaryThe possibility of enhancing attentional control
   through targeted interventions, be it computerized training or
   self-regulation techniques, is now well established. Embedding such
   training in video game play is appealing, given the astounding amount of
   time spent by children and adults worldwide with this media. It holds
   the promise of increasing compliance in patients and motivation in
   school children, and of enhancing the use of positive impact games. Yet
   for all the promises, existing research indicates that not all games are
   created equal: a better understanding of the game play elements that
   foster attention and learning as well as of the strategies developed by
   the players is needed. Computational models from machine learning or
   developmental robotics provide a rich theoretical framework to develop
   this work further and address its impact on developmental disorders.},

Abstract = {Learning anxiety has negative effects on learners' behaviours, attitudes
   and achievements in learning. Flipped learning is a blending of direct
   instruction with cooperative learning. Students study basic concepts and
   principles at home via instructional videos, and they learn in a group
   to solve problems or co-create knowledge in class. Thus, flipped
   learning requires students to learn autonomously at home, and to learn
   actively and cooperatively in class.
   In such a learning situation, it is anticipated that learners might feel
   fearful or uneasy in the process of individual learning and cooperative
   learning. However, few or no studies have focused on learners'
   psychological aspects in flipped learning. Therefore, this study
   purposed to identify learners' anxiety in flipped learning.
   Participants were 66 Japanese third-year university students who
   participated in an educational technology class. All of the participants
   were taking pre-service teacher education courses for elementary and
   secondary education. A self-report questionnaire sheet, which was a
   written form of free-response style, was used to identify learners'
   anxiety in ``flipped learning.{''} Participants were experiencing
   ``flipped{''} classes for five weeks at the time of the questionnaire
   survey. Participants were asked what they found uneasy, fearful or
   worried about in ``flipped learning.{''}
   As a result, 15 anxiety statements were identified as items for anxiety
   in ``flipped learning,{''} and among them, 13 items were classified into
   four clusters: `` communication anxiety,{''} `` achievement anxiety,{''}
   ``preparation anxiety,{''} and ``technology anxiety{''}. Given the
   findings of this study, it is necessary to develop a ``flipped
   learning{''} anxiety scale and to suggest instructors how to reduce
   learners' anxiety in flipped learning.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the active role of the students in their own learning process
   is demanded by the teachers who intend to work based on this philosophy.
   A possible way of approaching is based on the use of educative videos
   and the students' prior documentation reading supplied by the professor.
   In this study, we used this methodology to teach a specific theme which
   integrates Hydrotherapy unit of the course General Physiotherapy. This
   course is located in the first semester of second year of Physiotherapy
   Degree at University of Vigo. Our objective was to explore the students'
   opinion on such experience with educative video.
   In order to achieve the objective, at the end of the educative
   experience, an ad hoc questionnaire was filled by the students where
   their opinion on the development of the activity was reflected. 45 of
   the 56 enrolled students in the course of General Physiotherapy
   participated in the study. The activity and its subsequent evaluation
   were held in the academic year of 2013-2014.
   Our main results reflected a positive assessment on the good work
   environment, the explanations given by the teacher after the autonomous
   studying, the facilitation of learning, the adequate learning/teaching
   space used, the preference for the employed methodology instead of the
   traditional one, and the high level of comprehension and understanding
   of the proposed theme. In relation to the aspects with lowest rating we
   could list timeline (on the one hand there was much time to develop the
   activity as a whole, on the other hand there was few time to the
   in-person part of the activity), the fact that there was an exam after
   the activity (few students also pointed it as positive in order of
   retaining knowledge), and the lack of prior documentation reading
   (self-criticism).
   In conclusion, we would stress that this experience was positively
   assessed by the students in order to promote subjects comprehension and
   knowledge acquisition. But still, we could not affirm that the extended
   use of this methodology in the rest of the course would also be
   positively assessed by the students.},

Title = {A microanalysis of expert-student dialogue videos: Supporting
   preparation and learning for clinical competence assessment},

Abstract = {Introduction The aim of this qualitative study was to analyse students'
   perceptions and impact of using a novel video genre designed to support
   their learning and preparation for a clinical competence assessment. The
   videos demonstrate expert-student dialogue (ESD) of authentic,
   one-on-one discourse between the teacher and student, relating to the
   case presentation and self-evaluation of the assessment.
   Methods Students who were about to perform a competence assessment were
   invited to participate in the study. Students were asked to watch a
   relevant ESD video they had not previously had access to, which showed
   the examiner-examinee dialogue relating to a peer's tooth preparation
   for the competence assessment. Immediately after watching the video, a
   video simulated recall approach was performed to analyse students'
   perceptions. Thematic analysis was performed to induce relevant themes.
   Results Five themes were identified: analysis and judgement,
   observational learning from expert dialogue, observational learning from
   student dialogue, self-efficacy and empathy. Positive responses from
   interviews suggested high cognitive engagement with this video genre
   with an affective component that was also valued as an informative
   learning resource. Students reported the video could stimulate them to
   think, make it easier to remember knowledge, avoid errors observed, and
   gain insights into assessment process and examiner's expectations.
   Empathy was also reported towards the examinee in the video.
   Conclusions The ESD videos facilitated students' active and analytical
   thinking as well as improved their assessment preparedness. This video
   genre has shown how observing ESD can support students' learning and
   preparation for a clinical competence assessment.},

Abstract = {Active learning (AL) is a well-known teaching method in engineering
   because it allows to foster learning and critical thinking of the
   students by employing debate, hands-on activities, and experimentation.
   However, most educational results of this instructional method have been
   achieved in face-to-face educational settings and less has been said
   about how to promote AL and experimentation for online engineering
   education. Then, the main aim of this study was to create an AL
   methodology to learn electronics, physical computing (PhyC),
   programming, and basic robotics in engineering through hands-on
   activities and active experimentation in online environments. N = 56
   students of two engineering programs (Technology in Electronics and
   Industrial Engineering) participated in the methodology that was
   conceived using the guidelines of the integrated course design model
   (ICDM) and in some courses combining mobile and online learning with an
   Android app. The methodology gathered three main components: (1) In-home
   laboratories performed through low-cost hardware devices, (2)
   Student-created videos and blogs to evidence the development of skills,
   and (3) Teacher support and feedback. Data in the courses were collected
   through surveys, evaluation rubrics, semistructured interviews, and
   students' grades and were analyzed through a mixed approach. The
   outcomes indicate a good perception of the PhyC and programming
   activities by the students and suggest that these influence motivation,
   self-efficacy, reduction of anxiety, and improvement of academic
   performance in the courses. Even, the PhyC activities can reduce the
   differences in academic performance between women and male students and
   promote their improvement toward excellence with better results for
   courses combining online and mobile learning. Similarly, women students
   preferred to use more often tutoring services and had a better
   perception of the teacher's feedback than their male pairs. The
   methodology and previous results can be useful for researchers and
   practitioners interested in developing AL methodologies or strategies in
   engineering with online, mobile, or blended learning modalities.},

Abstract = {The IT boom in the world has contributed to the wider application and
   development of e-learning/e-studies in the higher education of Latvia as
   well. E-studies are the studies, which take place with the application
   of electronic technologies: telecommunication and computer networks,
   radio and TV, video records, interactive TV and multimedia CD-ROM. In
   some countries e-studies are understood as online studies in the
   network. An especially organized virtual environment is an essential
   feature of e-studies, interactive study materials for instructors and
   students self-study, possibilities of self-assessment for both and the
   support of instructors in the study process.
   E-study principles enter Latvian higher education institutions slowly,
   however. It is stressed by specialists -during the next years students
   and lecturers more and more will discover the opportunities offered by
   modern technology. Practically it is: the instructor is reading the
   lecture face-to-face, but the variety of study materials, tests, group
   work and project development is organized virtually: discussion forums,
   chats with instructors and classmates, etc. Twenty years ago the
   telephone and fax, radio and TV, audio and later video were technologies
   characteristic of distance learning. It was possible to achieve a
   remarkable improvement in the quality of studies.
   E-studies/e-learning is more than only business. The new teaching
   methodology is characteristic to this form of learning, which differs
   from full-time study. Via e-learning the student acquires the necessary
   information society added value of education -learns not only the
   subject matter, but also learns how to work with new technologies. In
   Latvian universities e-studies are realized in different versions. One
   of the most common is the acquisition of study courses attending
   lectures in person at the university as well as working in a virtual
   environment.
   The problem with e-studies is that in Latvian universities, it is
   necessary not only to explore new technologies and to acquire new study
   habits, but also to encourage not only students but also the lecturers
   themselves to use the new study technology. The latest trends show that
   study work is increasingly switched to the virtual environment, but that
   does not mean that, thinking about the quality of studies, the ``effect
   of presence{''} will disappear, which cannot be provided by e-studies
   without the sufficient ``effect of presence{''} of the lecturer.
   Students wish to mix-face-to-face lectures where the teacher can be
   asked what they do not understand and also work in a virtual
   environment. That is the way to make study process more effective and to
   improve the quality of specific courses.
   E-study is becoming more and more popular in the world. However, aiming
   for maximum quality, such studies recquires large capital investments in
   different sectors as well.},

Abstract = {Driven by the increasingly expanding higher educational environments and
   expectations of nurses as lifelong agents of reflective practice,
   Schools of Nursing continue to explore new pedagogical approaches to
   graduate level learning. In this article, we showcase the context,
   design, and effectiveness of one such pedagogical approach in a graduate
   nursing theories course. We share our approach (including educational
   aids) in implementing online reflective journaling within an
   asynchronous threaded online discussion forum to complement our video-
   and tele-conferenced classroom teaching. Despite it being a common
   nursing educational method, we believe journaling has not been used to
   its fullest potential. For example, traditional journaling often results
   in isolated writing and unshared entries. According to our graduate
   students, the online reflective journaling approach facilitates
   connections to self and others through the dissemination of practice
   experiences in peer-to-peer learning of major course concepts that
   inform their evolving philosophies of nursing. We briefly review the
   literature on the benefits and outcomes of online discussion forums in
   graduate nursing education. We explain the approach, constructivist
   conceptualization, and methodology adopted in designing and implementing
   our semi-structured reflective journaling activity. Finally, we provide
   our analysis of online reflective journaling and discuss the
   characteristics of an effective online discussion environment that
   renders student-centred learning, in which students are invited to
   imagine, construct, and reconstruct their learning individually and with
   their peers.},

Abstract = {To create effective learning environments for students, it is important
   to continually evolve curriculum and teaching strategies. This may
   involve an open pedagogy that encourages research within the classroom,
   promotes real-world problem-solving, and incorporates case studies,
   projects, and videos to enhance personalized and collaborative learning.
   These strategies can be implemented in both in-person, blended, and
   online learning settings to ensure that students receive a well-rounded
   education. This study delves into the practice of open pedagogy through
   the principle of Two-Eyed Seeing, which helps to integrate the powers of
   Indigenous ways of knowing with one eye, and Western ways of knowing
   with the other eye, for the benefit of teaching ethical professional
   practice in undergraduate engineering and computing programs. The
   students' self-assessments and feedback revealed noticeable improvements
   in their skills and competencies. This integrated approach to curriculum
   and pedagogy fosters critical and creative thinking in learners and
   cultivates a growth mindset that empowers them to take charge of their
   learning.},

Volume = {14},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {We developed and launched an online, course-integrated module called
   Growth \& Goals aimed to help students better develop evidence-based
   learning skills. The module focuses on five main concepts:
   self-regulated learning, goal-setting, metacognition, mindfulness, and
   mindsets (growth and fixed continuum). Growth \& Goals is an open
   education resource available for download at no cost to any educator
   through FlynnResearchGroup.com/GrowthGoals. The module is available in
   both French and English and can be customized to any university course.
   The module addresses the aforementioned concepts through a combination
   of text and videos, with interspersed interactive activities that
   students use to develop their learning skills. Growth \& Goals is
   intended to help students effectively manage the challenges they may
   encounter as they progress through their postsecondary academic career
   and beyond and become more proficient learners. Since 2017, the module
   has been implemented in more than 15 university courses and has been
   used by over 8000 students. The preliminary evaluation of Growth \&
   Goals has been largely positive, indicating that the module has been
   well received by both students and educators and that it successfully
   guides students in learning the module's concepts.},

   understand how they are experienced. Whereas previous studies typically

   recording the lecture difficulty in real-time with a physical slider,
   enabling continuous and fine-grained analysis of the learning
   experience. We evaluated our approach in a study with 100 participants
   viewing two variants of two short lectures. We demonstrate that our
   approach helps us paint a more complete picture of the learning
   experience. Our analysis has design implications for instructors,
   providing them with a method that helps them compare their expectations
   with students' beliefs about the lectures and to better understand the
   specific effects of different instructional design decisions.},

Title = {Anatomical knowledge enhancement through echocardiography and videos,
   with a spotlight on cognitive load, self-efficacy, and motivation},

Abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance
   of integrating ultrasound into undergraduate medical curricula. However,
   empirical evidence is lacking as to its effect on anatomy learning and
   related student cognition. Therefore, the present study compared the
   impact of echocardiography-based instruction with narrated videos on
   students' understanding of anatomical relationships, as well as the
   interaction with students' autonomous motivation, self-efficacy beliefs,
   mental load, and attitudes. Second-year medical students were given the
   opportunity to enroll in a supplementary booster course about cardiac
   anatomy. On the base of a randomized controlled trial with a cross-over
   design, we studied the effect of taking this course on spatial
   anatomical knowledge. After completing a pre-test (T0), students were
   allocated randomly to either the echocardiography-based teaching
   condition (cohort A) or the narrated anatomy video condition (cohort B).
   Next, participants were crossed over to the alternative intervention.
   Immediately after each phase in the intervention, students were asked to
   rate their mental load. Additionally, a spatial anatomical knowledge
   test, an autonomous motivation scale, and a self-efficacy scale were
   administered before (T0) and after the first intervention (T1) and at
   the end of the study (T2). Finally, each student completed a
   perception-based survey. The study design allowed a comparative
   evaluation of both interventions at T1, while the cross-over design
   facilitated the assessment of the most optimal sequencing in the
   interventions at T2. A total of 206 students participated (cohort A: n =
   99, cohort B: n = 107). At T1, no significant differences in the
   knowledge test and the autonomous motivation scale were observed between
   cohorts A and B. However, cohort A showed higher self-efficacy beliefs
   compared to cohort B (p = 0.043). Moreover, cohort A reported higher
   levels of perceived mental load (p < 0.001). At T2, the results showed
   that neither sequence of interventions resulted in significant
   differences in anatomy scores, autonomous motivation, or self-efficacy.
   However, a significant difference in mental load was found again, with
   students in cohort B reporting a higher level of mental load (p <
   0.001). Finally, based on the perception-based survey, students reported
   favorably on the echocardiography experience. In conclusion, the
   hands-on echocardiography sessions were highly appreciated by the
   medical students. After participating in the ultrasound sessions, they
   reported higher levels of self-efficacy beliefs compared to the
   video-based condition. However, despite embodied cognition principles,
   students in the echocardiography condition did not outperform students
   in the narrated anatomy video condition. The reported levels of mental
   load in the ultrasound condition could explain these findings.},

Abstract = {To promote learners' effective engagement in e-Learning course, this
   study designed and implemented an e-Learning course named Novice
   Teachers' Educational Technology Training Course for 279 teaching
   novices in a self-directed e-Learning environment. As students were
   engaged in the tasks, we monitored their engagement and conducted an
   evaluation on a micro-video that the students created by the two course
   designers. The study found that: 1) Process-oriented assessment which
   are behavioral engagements in self-directed e-Learning course can
   promote learners to finish the learning activity and get high scores. 2)
   High-level behavioral engagement does not equate to high-level cognitive
   engagement while learners' cognitive engagement is more important than
   behavioral engagement. 3) There exists differences between high-level
   and low-level learning achievement in the cognitive engagement of
   learning activities. High-level achievement learners are more actively
   participating in learning activities, such as reflection, doing,
   discussion and publishing works. Therefore, for course designers, they
   should design more learning activities which go from absorption to
   participation and to creation.},

   digital world problems such as education, sports event coverage, news
   and media domains. This work introduces a novel approach to summarize
   videos, primarily video lectures by varying the video playback frame
   rate without removing any frames from the video. This is accomplished by
   using Self organizing feature maps so as to learn from previous users'
   data and give the optimized playback frame rate as the output. A video
   player is modified to record the key strokes and create a database of
   previous users' playback preferences. Being a self-learning system, the
   accuracy of results is better when training is done using a vast set of
   data. Finally, a comparison of the original video and the final output
   video is made by analyzing the experience of volunteers.},

Abstract = {Instructional videos are widely-used resources in online learning. To
   enhance the effectiveness of instructional videos, prompts can be
   provided to learners and support their learning processes. According to
   the Interactive, Constructive, Active, Passive (ICAP) framework, the
   present study compared the effect of summary and self-explanation
   prompts on the metacognitive monitoring process and learning
   performance. In Study 1, 156 participants were randomly assigned to
   summary prompt, self-explanation prompt, and control conditions. Results
   showed that the summary prompt helped learners to perform better on
   retention test, but no effect was found on transfer test. Study 2
   further explored the effects of these two prompts on the metacognitive
   monitoring process. Fifty participants were randomly assigned to summary
   prompt, self-explanation prompt, or control groups. Results indicated
   that both prompts helped participants to achieve greater scores on

Abstract = {Background: E-learning has been widely carried out in higher education,
   but it also has some drawbacks, such as requirements of self-learning
   initiative and computer skills, and sense of isolation. In previous
   years, many researchers put forward blended learning, the mixture of
   e-learning and face-to-face learning, taking advantages of both learning
   modes. Now blended learning has grown rapidly in education, but it is at
   the preliminary stage of exploration, and there is a lack of studies
   that have examined the satisfaction with blended learning. Objective: To
   evaluate medical students' satisfaction and attitudes toward blended
   learning compared with previous traditional learning in medical
   education. Methods: The randomized controlled trial course lasted two
   weeks and included three parts: 1) slides, videos, further reading and
   discussion forum on Moodle interactive platform for e-learning; 2)
   contact session with local tutors, including questions answering and
   works on protocol; 3) face-to-face lectures and comments on protocol
   from a professor. A total of 27 medical students from Tongji Medical
   College of Huazhong University of Science \& Technology voluntarily took
   full participation in the course. After the course, questionnaire survey
   on satisfaction and attitudes was conducted via e-mail. Results: The
   response rate was 96.3\% (26/27). Of all the respondents, 92.3\% (24/26)
   were satisfied with the blended learning mode. Compared with previous
   traditional learning experience, 100\% of the respondents believed that
   blended learning is more helpful and that they had better access to the
   learning materials and greater independence in study, 84.6\% (22/26)
   thought their motivation was improved, 92.3\% (24/26) believed their
   involvement with the course was increased, 73.1\% (19/26) felt more in
   control of their learning, 88.5\% (23/26) thought learning was more
   efficient. Moreover, 65.4\% (17/26) were happy with the current mixture
   of e-learning and face-to-face contact time. Conclusions: Our results
   suggest that most of the medical students are satisfied with blended
   learning and that blended learning is better and more helpful than both
   traditional face-to-face learning and e-learning. Blended learning is
   promising and worthwhile for further application in medical education in
   China.},

Abstract = {The low self-efficacy has been an important issue in the design of
   instructional methods, and its negative effects are mainly shown by the
   reduced willingness to learn and the high dropout and failure rates.
   Game-based learning has received attention in the design of t
   instructional methods because of the combination of learning content and
   games. In this study, we use addressing modes learning in operation
   system course as a case object to explore the potential of improving the
   low self-efficacy by game-based learning. To this end, a side-scrolling
   video game was designed to complete the case study task to examine the
   effect of game-based learning on solving the low self-efficacy issue.
   According to the experimental results, there was no difference in
   learning achievement between the experimental group students who used
   game-based learning, and the control group students who used traditional
   learning methods. However, with similar scores in learning achievement,
   the experimental group students showed higher self-efficacy than the
   control group students. In addition, it was shown that the game-based
   learning approach did not impose additional cognitive load.},

Abstract = {This study uses the technology acceptance model (TAM) to help explain
   how the use of technology influences learning outcomes emanating from
   engagement with the Zoom video conference platform. To this end,
   structural equation modeling was used to analyze the relationships among
   the TAM variables in reference to Zoom taught during the Covid-19
   pandemic. Following a cross-sectional research design, data were
   collected using Davis's TAM (1989) scales including perceived ease of
   use (PEoU), perceived usefulness (PU), behavioral intentions, and
   attitude from 321 South Korean university students attending their
   10(th) week of English as a foreign language (EFL) conversational
   English classes. Results revealed that seven of the ten proposed
   hypotheses were confirmed, with path coefficients having small to large
   effect sizes. Most notably, PEoU with Zoom strongly affected PU and
   actual use. In addition, PU with Zoom predicted intentions to use Zoom
   in the future; however, it failed to influence perceived learning
   outcomes. While PU predicted future use, it did not influence actual use
   regarding how well students reported their current performance in their
   video conference course. PEoU with video conference tools was an
   influential antecedent to usefulness, attitude, and perceived learning
   outcome. Lastly, two notable instances of mediation through PU occurred.
   In consideration of findings, students and instructors should be well
   trained on the use and functionality of video conference software before
   its implementation in video conference classrooms.},

Abstract = {Online video gaming has transformed the minds of the Electronic
   Generation, rendering conventional classroom techniques inappropriate.
   Thus, educators and education scholars have been exploring and
   developing video games for learning. Since the Philippine public
   education system cannot yet afford to adopt the trend, the traditional
   classroom must accommodate the needs of the Electronic Generation.
   This study aimed to find out how values students find in online gaming
   can help create better learning environments. Specifically, it aimed to:
   1) identify how the gamers view education and learning; 2) identify the
   values that emerged from gamers' personal constructs, and 3) explain how
   online gaming values can help recreate the classroom.
   This qualitative study interviewed 10 Filipino senior high school
   students who were active in playing online games. They had been selected
   on the basis of sex, school grades, length of gaming time, clan
   membership, and family income. Guided by Kelly's Personal Construct
   Theory, in-depth interviews employing the laddering technique were
   conducted to surface their views and values about online gaming.
   The elicited values indicated that the challenge lies not in the nature
   of the traditional classroom but in the students' valuing of education.
   Students view learning as a chance to get a diploma, which is a stepping
   stone for a career. However, learning is a process. Since students
   simply look at the end goal, they miss out on the intricacies of
   learning. On the other hand, the nature of gaming is rooted in
   adventure. Adventures begin when adventurers embark on a quest. As they
   meet challenges along the way, they become stronger. As they eventually
   meet their goal, they realize that the journey is more important than
   the destination. Students identified four main values that are present
   in adventures, namely: self-concept, emancipation/escape, practicality,
   and networks. Self-concept is the most important
   value for the gamers. Here, the adventurer becomes the adventure itself.
   Quests transform into venues for knowing the ``self{''} that are linked
   to worth, hard work, self-improvement and preference. An adventurer's
   worth is defined by his self-worth and his worth in the community. They
   also value the hard work that they exert to conquer challenges.
   Conquering challenges require selfimprovement, i.e., the constant desire
   to become stronger. Finally, preference reflects what gamers want.
   On the other hand, emancipation allows gamers to be free. They can have
   a sense of control, something that is not present in real life. However,
   players may also use video games to escape marginalization in real life.
   Practicality deals with pragmatism and focuses on skills building,
   prioritizing and maximizing resources. They seek for real life uses of
   the elements found in-game.
   Finally, games allow players to seek new friends, or strengthen old
   bonds. These friendships can help create improve teamwork.
   Once these values are adopted from the gaming environment, students can
   experience a learning environment filled with adventure. Hopefully, it
   can aid in unlearning the diploma mentality of Filipino learners.},

Abstract = {Video-based modeling capitalizes on technology to increase the
   efficiency of modeling interventions for individuals with disabilities.
   Video self-modeling is a specific form of video-based modeling that
   utilizes the learner as the model to provide an opportunity for the
   learner to view him or herself as competent. This meta-analysis
   investigated the efficacy of video-self modeling using articles that met
   quality criteria with a focus on potential moderators of effect
   including participant characteristics, targeted outcomes, and
   implementation components. Results indicated strong effects for
   preschool and elementary aged participants with autism spectrum
   disorders, particularly when social-communicative and behavioral
   outcomes were addressed. In regards to implementation variables,
   significantly larger effect sizes were obtained when positive
   self-review was implemented as compared to feed forward. Additionally,
   video self-modeling implemented alone yielded stronger effects than
   video self-modeling implemented with programmed reinforcement or as part
   of a package. Gaps in the evidence are identified including limited
   evidence for the use of video self-modeling with older participants and
   participants with disabilities other than autism. Implications and
   suggestions for future research are discussed.},

Title = {Developing cultural competence through self-reflection in
   interprofessional education: Findings from an Australian university},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERPROFESSIONAL CARE},

Pages = {347-354},
Abstract = {Interprofessional education and cultural competence are both necessary
   for health professionals working in interprofessional teams serving
   diverse populations. Using a pre-post-survey case series design, this
   study evaluates a novel learning activity designed to encourage
   self-reflection and cultural competence in an Australian
   interprofessional education context. Undergraduate health professional
   students in a large subject viewed three 7-15 minute videos featuring
   interviews with persons of a minority cultural, linguistic, or sexual
   group who were living with a disability or managing a health condition.
   Immediately afterwards, students in interprofessional groups completed a
   structured activity designed to promote interprofessional and cultural
   reflection. A localised version of a validated scale measured cultural
   competence before and after the learning activity. Results suggest the
   value of video-based learning activities based on real-life examples for
   improving cultural competence. Despite initially rating themselves
   highly, 64\% of students (n = 273) improved their overall cultural
   competence, though only by M = 0.13, SD = 0.08, of a 5-point
   rating-scale interval. A nuanced approach to interpreting results is
   warranted; even slight increases may indicate improved cultural
   competence. Suggestions for improving the effectiveness of video-based
   cultural competence learning activities, based on qualitative findings,
   are provided. Overall the findings attest to the merit of group
   discussion in cultural competence learning activities in
   interprofessional education settings. However, the inclusion of group
   discussions within such learning activities should hinge on group
   dynamics.},

Abstract = {Despite the recent advancement of virtual education during the last
   pandemic, mastering clinical competencies remains challenging. The
   current study endorsed Synchronised Video-assisted Clinical Skill lab
   Sessions (SVCSLS) as a novel instructional design aiming to improve
   medical students' clinical competencies during virtual learning. The
   current study is a mixedmethod study that was carried out among 210
   medical students at a medical college in Saudi Arabia. It was revealed
   that students viewed SVCSLSs as an effective and safe tool during times
   of crisis. Students' performance did not show significant variations in
   all program phases compared with face-to-face learning. SVCSLSs has many
   advantages, including enjoyment, continuous access to learning material,
   Self-Directed Learning, fostering recall and memorisation, and enhancing
   higher cognitive skills. Students suggested that the sessions' content
   be updated, that workplace-related videos be added, and that
   constructive feedback is provided. Students recommended updating the
   contents of the sessions, enriching them with workplace-based videos,
   and providing constructive feedback. Though SVCSLSs have been proven to
   be an effective tool, we recommend using them during a crisis rather
   than replacing the face-to-face mode of learning in normal
   circumstances.},

Abstract = {Along with the rapid development of computer and Internet technologies,
   efforts have been conducted to include design, development, and
   evaluation of computer applications for learning activities. Although
   extensive research has defined the use of computer applications in
   various disciplines, few studies have systematically investigated
   students' self-regulated learning skills while learning with an
   interactive learning module specifically in computer science education.
   The purposes of this study are to investigate high school students'
   computer self-efficacy, cognitive, and metacognitive strategies while
   students learn with the interactive learning modules and performing a
   mixed-methods study. Data collection included students' self-reports and
   traces of student activity. The quantitative analyses applicable to this
   study included descriptive and non-parametric statistics. Qualitative
   data were gathered from interactive learning module screen-captured
   videos and interview transcripts to support findings from quantitative
   data. The outcome of this study will inform policy makers, educators,
   researchers, developers, and others of the importance of a
   self-regulated learning perspective when designing instruction using an
   interactive learning module.},

Title = {A non-randomised trial of video and written educational adjuncts in
   undergraduate ophthalmology},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},

Month = {JAN 9},
Abstract = {Background Provision of relevant pre-learning materials has been shown
   to increase student engagement and improve outcomes in medical
   education. This non-randomised study attempts to quantify the
   educational gains, and relative efficacy of video and written
   pre-learning materials, in ophthalmology undergraduate teaching. Methods
   Ninety-eight final year medical students were contacted prior to their
   three-day ophthalmology placements at a British tertiary ophthalmology
   unit. All participants were sent welcome packs prior to arrival
   requesting they undertake 90 min of work focusing on a list of specified
   ophthalmic conditions. One cohort (N = 33) were sent written materials,
   another (N = 32) was provided with video materials and a third cohort (N
   = 33) were not sent any materials. On arrival participants completed a
   simple knowledge test, a questionnaire estimating the time they spent
   preparing for the placement and a self-reported knowledge score. The
   teaching on placement was the same for all cohorts. At the conclusion of
   each placement participants completed a challenging knowledge test, a
   clinical skills test and repeated self-reported knowledge scores.
   Results Eighty seven percent of students receiving specified materials
   claimed to complete pre-placement work compared to 70\% of those
   receiving learning outcomes alone (p = 0.05). Students receiving
   learning materials scored higher in the post-placement tests of
   knowledge (p < 0.001), 74.8\% (72.4-77.2\%) vs 63.6\% (95\%CI
   59.3-67.9\%) and skills (p = 0.04), 86.9\% (83.9-89.9\%) vs 81.3\%
   (77.2-85.4\%). Students using video resources outperformed students
   using written materials in their visual acuity assessment test (p =
   0.03), 90.4\% (86.6-94.2\%) vs 83.6\% (80.1-87.1\%) whilst those
   receiving written rather than video material performed better in the end
   of placement knowledge test (p = 0.03), 77.7\% (74.3-81.1\%) vs 72.0\%
   (68.9-75.1\%). Conclusion This study showed that providing pre-placement
   learning materials improves undergraduates' commitment and achievement.
   Written materials better facilitate knowledge acquisition while video
   materials preferentially promote skill acquisition. This is a novel
   demonstration within ophthalmology and can help address the imbalance
   between the expectations placed on undergraduates and the resources
   committed to ensuring they are met.},

Abstract = {In physical education, assessment is a fundamental component of
   purposeful and meaningful learning experiences for students, with the
   predominant goal to support and enhance student learning. Implementing
   the use of digital technologies in physical education can also
   contribute to improved engagement, motivation and student learning.
   While there is a substantial amount of research around digital
   technology and physical education within secondary school, less research
   exists around using digital technology to support quality assessment
   practices, particularly in a lower-primary physical education setting.
   Therefore, the purpose of this paper was to explore one physical
   educators' experience using digital technology to support assessment
   implementation in an Australian primary physical education setting.
   Three themes were identified through analysis: shifting assumptions of
   practice, building comprehension and application, and challenges and
   opportunities in attempting to implement quality assessment using
   digital technology. We highlight the value of self-study research as
   professional learning for practising teachers and the importance of
   assessment literacy.},

Journal = {BEHAVIOUR CHANGE},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {32},
Number = {1},
Pages = {46-58},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Being able to read at a fluent rate confers many advantages on an
   individual in both educational and wider social contexts throughout
   life. To be a fluent reader means that the individual can sustain high
   accuracy while reading at a rate appropriate to the material and the
   setting, and implies the development of automaticity in the cognitive
   processes involved in reading. Fluency has not, however, been the focus
   of much research. In this study, an observational learning technique -
   feedforward video self-modelling (FFVSM) - was used to improve
   children's reading fluency. Eleven primary (elementary) school children
   aged between 72 and 108 months, four girls and seven boys, viewed edited
   video footage of themselves seemingly reading a difficult text at a
   fluent rate six times over a 2-week period. Reading performance
   (accuracy, comprehension and rate) was measured at pre- and post-test
   using the Neale Analysis of Reading Ability, and fluency and
   comprehension scores were measured across the intervention period using
   the Science Research Associates Reading Laboratory (SRA) graded reading
   texts. The results showed that the majority of the children improved
   their reading fluency, comprehension and accuracy as well as reader
   self-perception (a proxy measure of self-efficacy). These positive
   results suggest that FFVSM could be a rapid, cost-effective intervention
   to be used within educational settings to promote fluent reading.},

Title = {Enhancing ACLS training effects through video-assisted boosting methods:
   A comparative analysis of self-simulation and model simulation videos},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {78},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Aims: To assess the impact of learner-participation and instructor-led
   simulation videos on nurses' CPR skills, focusing on iterative learning
   to boost proficiency in ACLS. Background: Advanced cardiac life support
   (ACLS) training is crucial for nurses, especially to improve
   cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) proficiency, for which an effective
   training strategy is needed. Design: A quasi-experimental,
   pretest-posttest design was implemented to assess the impact of
   self-simulation and model simulation videos on sustaining CPR education.
   Methods: The research was carried out at a university hospital in Korea
   from August 2021 to July 2022. A total of 110 nurses were allocated into
   three groups based on the building of their workplace in the hospital.
   Each group watched training videos at 4-month intervals after the
   simulation training. The self-video group viewed simulations featuring
   their participation, while the model video group watched instructor-led
   simulations. A comparison group participated in the simulations without
   subsequent video boosting. Results: Both the self-video and model video
   groups exhibited significantly superior ACLS performance compatred with
   the comparison group at both four months (H = 70.33, p <.001) and eight
   months (H = 81.52, p <.001) following the intervention, with large
   effect sizes (self-video vs. comparison: d = 4.73 at four months, d =
   12.54 at eight months; model video vs. comparison: d = 4.53 at four
   months, d = 11.01 at eight months). ACLS knowledge scores also
   significantly increased over time in both intervention groups
   (self-video: chi(2) = 22.09, p <.001; model video: chi(2) = 24.13, p
   <.001), but not in the comparison group (chi(2) = 3.75, p =.153). There
   were no significant differences among the groups in terms of CPR
   self-efficacy or stress at either time point. Conclusion: Supplementary
   training using simulation videos is an effective method for maintaining
   and enhancing nurses' ACLS competency, offering a sustainable approach
   to repetitive CPR training. This study underscores the value of
   incorporating recorded simulation videos in clinical training, offering
   insights into efficient methods for continuous learning and CPR
   proficiency among nursing professionals.},

Abstract = {The reflection of video-based teaching situations has established itself
   as an important tool for combining theory and practice in teacher
   training. Videos make it possible to analyse teaching situations based
   on theory, i.e. to describe and interpret teaching actions and their
   consequences and, if necessary, to develop alternative courses of
   action. They allow a kind of vicarious experience that is accessible to
   subsequent reflection. In addition to the mentioned analytical mental
   processes, lesson reflection also requires that the vicarious
   experiences and the knowledge gained from them are related to one's own
   person. This self-reference can be seen as an important part of the
   reflection process. It is necessary to investigate more closely which
   dimensions can be distinguished in relation to self-reference and to
   what extent student teachers are able to establish the self-reference in
   depth right at the beginning of their studies. For this purpose, the
   qualitative data of 133 student teachers in the bachelor's degree were
   analysed. Five dimensions of self-reference could be classified and
   empirically proven (1. competencies, 2. fit and identification, 3.
   values and beliefs, 4. personal learning effect and 5. emotions). These
   are potentially open to extensions. The depth of the self-references was
   also considered. Within the framework of correlation analyses, their
   connection with situational interest and the motivation to create a
   self-reference was also examined. As expected, students who were more
   interested in the situation and motivated to create a self-reference
   tended to write more extensive self-references. However, the majority
   focused on one dimension. Although not all students were able to
   establish a self-reference. The developed analysis scheme is also
   available for future research projects and can be described as
   sufficiently intersubjectively comprehensible on the basis of the
   interrater procedure. The classified dimensions can also be used as a
   stimulus for reflection on (videographed) teaching situations in studies
   and further education.},

Month = {NOV-DEC},
Abstract = {Background: Nursing students need to not only understand the
   pathophysiological basis of disease but also acquire insight into its
   effects on patients and their families.
   Purpose: Digital storytelling was used to engage students in
   self-directed, online learning, allowing them to identify with patients
   dealing with disease and its consequences.
   Methods: Scripts were written and videos created that simulated patient
   experiences with select diseases of the gastrointestinal and respiratory
   systems as well as diabetes. Videos plus online self-testing questions
   were provided to nursing students studying pathophysiology and student
   outcomes on summative examinations compared before and after
   introduction of the videos.
   Results: Students had improved outcomes on summative examination
   questions that targeted diseases addressed in the video modules.
   Conclusions: Digital storytelling is an effective way to portray illness
   from a patient perspective, and the addition of this approach to
   pathophysiology instruction can benefit student learning.},

Abstract = {Learning from home in the Covid-19 Pandemic period posed a variety of
   challenges both for teachers and for students. The ability of teachers
   to utilize technology in learning is very necessary so that distance
   learning can run effectively. This study aims to determine the
   self-perceptions and skills of prospective physics teachers in the
   Technological Pedagogical and Content Knowledge Knowledge (TPACK)
   framework to support distance learning. This research is a quantitative
   research. Self-Perceptions were screened using a questionnaire, 128
   research subjects were Physics education students in Samarinda,
   Indonesia. Then, the skills of prospective physics teachers in the TPACK
   framework to support distance learning were sought through video
   observations with 30 research subjects from 128 previous students. Based
   on data analysis, self-perceptions of prospective physics teachers
   within the TPACK framework in sufficient category. There is a
   significant difference between the self-perception of prospective
   physics teachers who have taken computer training and have never taken
   computer training. The skills of prospective physics teachers in the
   TPACK framework are also in the sufficient category. Based on this,
   educational institutions need to increase learning and training for
   prospective physics teachers to integrate technology in learning so that
   their TPACK skills can be improved.},

Title = {What makes spherical video virtual reality popular in education?
   Evidence from a meta-analysis employing Stata},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 26},
Abstract = {The widespread diffusion of portable tablets and 5G technology heralded
   a new era of mobile-assisted language learning. Educators and
   practitioners have shown keen interest in introducing spherical video
   virtual reality to facilitate pedagogical practices. Although a
   substantial number of empirical studies have been carried out to observe
   the effectiveness of SVVR-assisted education, scant attention has been
   given to synthesizing the effect sizes. To complement the missing link,
   this study aims to examine the overall effect of SVVR in interactive
   learning environments. Through a meta-analysis using Stata/SE 16 and
   Stata/MP 18, the current study has investigated the effects of eleven
   moderators on SVVR-assisted learning outcomes. From embodied cognitive
   linguistics standpoint, SVVR technology enhanced embodied pedagogy with
   4E cognition functions as the theoretical framework. Meta-analytic
   procedures include literature filtration, publication bias detection,
   sensitivity analysis, and moderator analysis. The results of the overall
   effect were (SMD = 0.564, p < 0.001), indicating SVVR could enhance the
   overall learning outcomes at a statistically significant level. It is
   concluded that SVVR technologies exert a positive influence at all
   educational levels on creativity, critical thinking, learning
   achievements, learning motivation, problem-solving ability,
   self-efficacy, and sense of presence, despite some unsignificant effects
   on cognitive load, engagement, and learning attitudes. The findings shed
   light on future research on SVVR to expand the sample size and adopt
   multiple research methods. Future study is encouraged to incorporate an
   advanced head-mounted display Apple Vision Pro to enhance educational
   outcomes.},

   Method on Focused Assessment With Sonography in Trauma Among House

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SURGERY},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Background: The aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
   self-instructional-video (SIV) and classroom training method (CTM) in
   learning Focus-Assessment with Sonography-in-Trauma (FAST) among house
   officers (HO).Method: A randomized controlled study involving house
   officers working in the university hospital in Malaysia was conducted
   where participants were randomized into SIV group (intervention) and CTM
   group (control). Each group had to undergo a 4 h hands-on training. The
   intervention group has undergone self-training using the video material
   without any facilitation while the control group received lecture and
   hands-on training with facilitators. Participants' performance was
   assessed using a validated Objective Structured Clinical Examination
   checklist for landmark identification and interpretation of images
   generated. Learning preference and confidence level were also
   assessed.Result: A total of 33 HO were enrolled in this study. Marks
   obtained in image acquisition by the intervention and control were 25.3
   (SD = 5.3) and 25.6 (SD = 2.3) p > 0.05, respectively. While in image
   interpretation, the mean score for the intervention and control group
   was 10.3 (SD 1.7) and 9.8 (SD = 1.7) p > 0.05, respectively. Overall
   performance assessment, showed the intervention group obtained 35.6 (SD
   = 5.9) compared to control 35.3 (SD = 3.4), p > 0.05. Based on
   pre-specified determinant these scores difference falls within the 10\%
   of non-inferiority margin. The absolute difference between both groups
   was 0.3 (CI = -3.75 to 3.21, p = 0.871), which proves non-inferiority
   but not superiority. In terms of learning preference and confidence to
   perform FAST, most of the participants preferred the control group
   approach.Conclusion: The SIV method is as effective as the CTM for
   learning FAST among the house officers and served as an alternative to
   classroom teaching. However, this technique needs improvement in
   promoting their confidence and preference. Perhaps incorporating a
   feedback session after going through the SIV would improve the
   confidence.},

Abstract = {Introduction Minimally invasive surgery skill laboratories are
   indispensable in training, especially for complex procedural skills such
   as intracorporal suturing and knot tying (ICKT). However, maintaining a
   laboratory is expensive, and specially trained teachers are in short
   supply. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person instruction has reduced
   to almost zero, while model learning via video instruction (VID) has
   become an integral part of medical education. The aim of this study was
   to compare the learning effectiveness and efficiency of ICKT by
   laparoscopically inexperienced medical students through video versus
   direct expert instruction. Materials and Methods A secondary analysis of
   two randomized controlled trials was performed. We drew data from
   students who were trained in ICKT with expert instruction (EXP, n = 30)
   and from students who were trained via VID, n = 30). A laparoscopic box
   trainer including laparoscope was used for ICKT. Objective Structured
   Assessment of Technical Skills (OSATS), knot quality, and total ICKT
   time were the parameters for the assessment in this study. Proficiency
   criteria were also defined for these parameters. Results Students in the
   EXP group performed significantly better in OSATS-procedure-specific
   checklist (PSC) and knot quality compared with students in the VID
   group, with no difference in task time. Of the students who reached the
   proficiency criteria for OSATS-PSC and knot quality, those in the EXP
   group required fewer attempts to do so than those in the VID group.
   Students in both groups improved significantly in all parameters over
   the first hour of evaluation. Conclusion For the laparoscopically
   inexperienced, training in ICKT through expert instruction presents an
   advantage compared with video-based self-study in the form of faster
   understanding of the procedure and the associated consistent
   implementation of good knot quality. Both teaching methods significantly
   improved participants' ICKT skills.},

Abstract = {Practical skills are essential in the veterinary nursing curriculum.
   Given the increasing implementation of video recording in higher
   education, this study explored the feasibility and benefits of video
   recording as a classroom tool in professional education. Concerns
   regarding the inability to monitor individual students' performance
   during their laboratory course promoted the implementation of video
   recording-a blended learning method-in a veterinary nursing course. The
   approach was personalized for this study, particularly for the Gram
   staining skill. Students submitted video recordings demonstrating the
   progression of their skills development, and the instructor reviewed the
   recordings for assessment. The Participant Perception Indicator, a
   self-assessment, was used to determine students' experience, knowledge,
   and confidence gained after performing the skill. Video recording helped
   students to identify areas for self-improvement. It is also a helpful
   tool for instructors to ensure that students are meeting the learning
   standards. The results suggest that the use of video recording in
   learning Gram staining skills was effective. The evidence-based approach
   maximized students' learning and engagement, and it improved
   individualized assessment by the instructor and enabled the instructor
   to provide feedback on students' performance. During this period of
   increasing reliance on online teaching and learning, video recording in
   a classroom environment could be more widely used by instructors.},

Title = {Learning from video modeling examples: Content kept equal, adults are

Abstract = {Learning from (video) modeling examples in which a model demonstrates
   how to perform a task is an effective instructional strategy. The
   model-observer similarity (MOS) hypothesis postulates that (perceived)
   similarity between learners and the model in terms of age or expertise
   moderates the effectiveness of modeling examples. Findings have been
   mixed, however, possibly because manipulations of MOS were often
   associated with differences in example content and manipulations of
   (perceived) expertise confounded with age. Therefore, we investigated
   whether similarity with the model in terms of age and putative expertise
   would affect cognitive and motivational aspects of learning when the
   example content is kept equal across conditions. Adolescents (N = 157)
   watched a short video in which a peer or adult model was introduced as
   having low or high expertise, followed by two video modeling examples in
   which the model demonstrated how to troubleshoot electrical circuit
   problems. Results showed no effects of putative expertise. In contrast
   to the MOS hypothesis, adult models were more effective and efficient to
   learn from than peer models. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Using Multimedia Dissection Videos to Supplement Learning of Veterinary
   Anatomy in the COVID Era and Beyond: Student Perceptions and Benefits},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF VETERINARY MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {51},
Number = {5},
Pages = {578-586},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Anatomy is a foundation for veterinary medical education, yet its
   teaching has traditionally posed an academic challenge to students.
   Anatomy is a three-dimensional (3D) subject that students are often
   expected to learn using one- or two-dimensional learning resources.
   Visualization of structures and the transfer of images to animal
   specimens can impede knowledge acquisition and student confidence. As a
   response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first-year anatomy course
   (Anatomy I) at The Ohio State University College of Veterinary Medicine
   was delivered virtually in Autumn 2020. Instructors were challenged to
   create equivalent learning experiences without face-to-face interaction
   and cadaveric access. Fortunately, multimedia dissection videos were in
   production and supplemented students' learning of anatomic structures
   and dissection techniques. Videos included complete narration,
   explanations, diagrams, labels, and self-check opportunities. To
   evaluate the perceived effectiveness of the videos on student learning,
   the Anatomy I teaching team surveyed all first-year veterinary students
   following the course. Of the 104 students (64\%) who completed the
   survey, 101 (97\%) agreed or strongly agreed that the videos helped
   solidify their anatomy knowledge, skills, and understanding. The most
   helpful video characteristics included the demonstration of dissection
   techniques on a cadaver and the visualization of structures on 3D
   specimens. Students also appreciated the ability to review content at
   their own pace/convenience, a feature inherent to recorded
   (asynchronous) video-based instruction. These data suggest that
   video-based instruction may effectively supplement students' learning of
   veterinary anatomy and improve the transfer of knowledge, particularly
   when other forms of direct instruction are inaccessible.},

Title = {Students' perceptions toward providing video-enhanced multimodal

Journal = {COMPUTER ASSISTED LANGUAGE LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 16},
Abstract = {Video feedback is a promising yet underutilized tool in language
   education, particularly in facilitating speaking performance
   assessments. This study delves into the specific applications and
   impacts of video feedback on language learners' perceptions. It
   incorporates a mixed-methods approach, including questionnaire responses
   from twenty participants and in-depth interviews with twelve. The key
   findings revealed that students significantly favoured video technology
   over traditional written feedback for their speaking performances.
   Specifically, over 75\% of participants expressed an elevated level of
   engagement and learning due to the multimodal and dialogic nature of
   video feedback. This interactive approach resulted in an enriching
   reflective learning experience, with learners demonstrating heightened
   awareness of their performance and areas for improvement. The study
   further identified the added advantage of learning autonomy, with
   students appreciating the ability to self-assess their performance
   through video feedback. This research addresses a significant research
   gap by shifting the focus from teachers' perspectives to students'
   viewpoints, specifically in the context of oral performance. It
   contributes valuable insights into the provision and efficacy of
   video-enhanced feedback for spoken language assessment.},

Abstract = {Objective: Appropriate training strategies are required to equip
   undergraduate healthcare students to benefit from communication training
   with simulated patients. This study examines the learning effects of
   different formats of video-based worked examples on initial
   communication skills.
   Methods: First-year nursing students (N = 36) were randomly assigned to
   one of two experimental groups (correct v. erroneous examples) or to the
   control group (no examples). All the groups were provided an identical
   introduction to learning materials on breaking bad news; the
   experimental groups also received a set of video-based worked examples.
   Each example was accompanied by a self-explanation prompt (considering
   the example's correctness) and elaborated feedback (the true
   explanation).
   Results: Participants presented with erroneous examples broke bad news
   to a simulated patient significantly more appropriately than students in
   the control group. Additionally, they tended to outperform participants
   who had correct examples, while participants presented with correct
   examples tended to outperform the control group.
   Conclusion: The worked example effect was successfully adapted for
   learning in the provider-patient communication domain.
   Practice Implications: Implementing video-based worked examples with
   self-explanation prompts and feedback can be an effective strategy to
   prepare students for their training with simulated patients, especially
   when examples are erroneous. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Simulated Video Consultations as a Learning Tool in Undergraduate
   Nursing: Students' Perceptions},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Number = {3},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Simulated video consultations, a teaching tool based on high-fidelity
   simulations, were implemented in response to the necessary adaptation of
   high-fidelity clinical simulation sessions to the online or virtual
   modality during the university closure due to the COVID-19 confinement.
   The purpose of our study was to explore the undergraduate nursing
   students' satisfaction and perceptions about simulated video
   consultations using the high-fidelity simulation methodology. A
   mixed-method was utilized with 93 undergraduate nursing students using a
   validated satisfaction questionnaire (quantitative data), which included
   an observations section (qualitative data). Of the total sample, 97.8\%
   of the students expressed a high overall satisfaction with simulated
   video consultations, highlighting their practical utility and positive
   learning outcomes. From the students' comments, two main themes and
   their related categories emerged: advantages (satisfaction and
   enjoyment, learning, and calmness during simulated scenarios), and
   disadvantages (technical issues and technical skills development).
   Simulated video consultations may be considered as one more
   high-fidelity simulation teaching option. Nursing students should be
   trained in this modality of healthcare to face the challenge brought on
   by its increased use in healthcare services, beyond the specific
   adaptation of clinical simulation sessions due to the closure of
   universities during this pandemic.},

Abstract = {This research employed school-based Inclusive Experimental Monitoring
   (IEM) mentoring within the scope of Kolb's (1984) experiential learning
   model. This was used to support pre-service teachers, combined with
   their existing undergraduate education at a Turkish university. The
   study undertook a mixed research approach, using the pre- and post-test
   experimental group (n=11) and control group (n=11). Various quantitative
   and qualitative data collection tools were used, including a personal
   information form, scales, questionnaires, video recordings, and
   unstructured observation. The results indicate that IEM has several
   positive outcomes for self-efficacy in inclusive education and readiness
   for the teaching profession. However, the study did not find any
   substantial changes in attitudes towards individuals with special
   educational needs, despite some observed positive impacts. It is
   believed that integrating IEM into the entire undergraduate education
   process can lead to further development in this regard.},

Title = {Improving the Behavioral Intention of Continuous Online Learning Among
   Learners in Higher Education During COVID-19},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic caused colleges and universities to rely heavily
   on online learning to continue knowledge dissemination to learners. This
   study used the second-generation model of unified theory of acceptance
   and use of technology (UTAUT2) to comprehensively analyze the mediating
   effects of self-efficacy, which affects learners' effective use of
   online tools for learning, and capability of metacognition and
   self-regulation, which can independently adjust learning progress into
   the UTAUT2 model, on the learner's willingness to continue online
   learning {[}i.e., their behavioral intention (BI)] by constructing a
   UTAUT2-based e-learning model. This study administered questionnaires to
   undergraduates in universities in East China to collect data. The
   effects of performance expectancy, effort expectancy (EE), social
   influence (SI), and facilitating conditions (FCs), hedonic motivation
   (HM), price value (PV), and habits on BI (directly or through mediators)
   were analyzed through data analysis and structural equation modeling,
   and the UTAUT2-based e-learning model was accordingly modified. The
   results indicated that the self-efficacy enhanced the effects of EE, SI,
   FCs, HM, and PV on learners' BI; that metacognition and self-regulation
   (MS) capabilities enhanced the effects of EE on learners' BI; and that
   habits had a direct and strong effect on BI. This study also provided
   some suggestions to enhance higher education learners' willingness to
   continue online learning, such as improving social recognition and
   support, careful design of teaching content, easy-to-use technology,
   financial support. These results and suggestions may guide colleges and
   universities in conducting, continuing, or enhancing online education,
   particularly as the pandemic continues.},

Abstract = {Robotic-assisted surgery (RAS) involves training processes and
   challenges that differ from open or laparoscopic surgery, particularly
   regarding the possibilities of observation and embodied guidance. The
   video recording and the dual-console system creates a potential
   opportunity for participation. Our research, conducted within the
   department of visceral surgery of a big Swiss, public, academic
   hospital, uses a methodology based on the co-analysis of video
   recordings with surgeons in self-confrontation interviews, to
   investigate the teaching activity of the lead surgeon supervising a
   surgeon in training at the dual console. Three short sequences have been
   selected for the paper. Our analysis highlights the
   skills-in-construction of the surgeon in training regarding
   communication with the operating team, fluency of working with three
   hands, and awareness of the whole operating site. It also shows the
   divergent necessities of enabling verbalization for professional
   training, while ensuring a quiet and efficient environment for medical
   performance. To balance these requirements, we argue that dedicated
   briefing and debriefing sessions may be particularly effective; we also
   suggest that the self-confrontation video technique may be valuable to
   support the verbalization on both the mentor's and the trainee's side
   during such debriefing, and to enhance the mentor's reflexivity
   regarding didactic choices.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SURGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {76},

Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Video-based teaching is considered highly effective in
   debriefing, especially in minimally invasive surgeries. In this study,
   the benefits of using a new integrated video recording system, were
   investigated and compared to those of the standard basic skills robotic
   training procedure.
   DESIGN: Fifty residents from the 2nd and 3rd year medical faculty
   without any experience of robot usage or laparoscopy were randomized
   into 2 groups: group A-a natural self-training group without a trainer,
   and group B-a self-training group assisted by an integrated video
   recording system during training. The training was divided into four
   2-hour sessions, with a 72-hour delay between each session. Two tasks
   were selected for testing on the dV-Trainer, a virtual reality based
   robotic simulator: Match board 2 and Thread the Rings 1. After each
   session, the practice video recorded by the system of group B was
   transferred to the residents' smartphones for self-debriefing. At the
   end of each session, the performance score was evaluated automatically
   by using the simulator to plot learning curves A and B.
   RESULTS: Group A showed a significant drop in performance score due to
   skill decay caused by the 72-hour delay. Group B exhibited a regular
   stepwise rising learning curve. At the end of the training, group B
   showed a significantly higher performance score both in Match board 2
   and Thread the Rings 1. The autoanalysis and capture function, which
   selects only the critical errors and most valuable parts, could
   facilitate time saving.
   CONCLUSIONS: The use of an integrated video recording system makes the
   self-manipulated protocol with own smartphone feasible to improve
   training efficiency and overcome the skill decay during robotic surgical
   training. (C) 2018 Association of Program Directors in Surgery.

Abstract = {The web offers rich learning resources, including technology education.
   With the advocate of hands-on learning and STEM education, many web
   videos teach users how to use technological tools to create STEM
   artifacts and acquire related science knowledge. These videos were
   adopted by teachers in their classroom and followed closely as
   pro-claimed technology education. As web credibility is a challenge and
   how students approach the topics to develop systematic knowledge are
   crucial, this study proposed a learning model to address these
   challenges. The model was embedded into a teacher training to have
   teachers self-experience these challenges. Participating teachers were
   expected to construct their pedagogical knowledge inductively, and their
   responses to the proposed learning were collected. With the
   participation of 27 in-service teachers, the results demonstrated
   teachers' recognition and support of the proposed model. However, their
   beliefs and concerns regarding its implementation generated uncertainty.
   Study results broaden the spectrum of hands-on teacher training.},

Abstract = {The elaboration of didactic learning units oriented to create
   methodological advantages for students could be an important effort of
   the educational process in University. The didactic learning units
   presented in this paper have the objective of complementing the class
   notes and the teacher's lectures. In order to improve the quality degree
   of education, these complements for students have been carried out in
   this work.
   The didactic learning units were developed for each topic in some
   subjects coursed in the Defense University Center of Marin (Spain) for
   the subject of Materials Engineering. The units try to simplify and to
   streamline the learning curve of the student. All of them have a common
   structure and explain the basic principles of the topic. At the
   beginning of document, the competencies of Bologna Process contained in
   each educational unit are detailed. Moreover, theoretical explanations
   about the topic are supplemented with several schemes and figures, which
   provide a clear view of all contents. Furthermore, they include a kind
   of colour speech balloons whose purpose is to exalt important concepts
   of the unit thematic. Other type of speech balloons shows anecdotes
   about lesson, which goal is to generate interest and curiosity by
   student. At the end of didactic learning units, there is a test with
   some basic questions to student self-assessment. If the subject allows
   practical exercises, the didactic learning unit includes some solved
   problems and several proposed problems. Finally, these educational
   documents were complemented with ``knowledge pills{''}, which are videos
   uploaded in the University network, available for students. In them, the
   teacher shows a presentation oriented to the educational learning unit
   presented.},

Abstract = {This study examines the effects of instructor presence and online
   learning self-efficacy on learning satisfaction, and how the effect of
   social presence may depend on content structure. In this study,
   undergraduate students in Singapore rated their online learning
   self-efficacy. Then they rated their learning satisfaction after
   watching each of four video lectures in a 2 (low versus high instructor
   presence) x 2 (low versus high content structure) repeated measures
   experiment. Findings show that learning satisfaction is related to
   instructor presence and online learning self-efficacy and that the
   effect of instructor presence is stronger for unstructured than for
   structured content. This study contributes to research on pedagogy and
   online learning by clarifying when and how instructor presence enhances
   learning outcomes. Although most kinds of instruction can benefit from
   higher levels of instructor presence, there is the greatest benefit for
   unstructured content, where teaching and learning involve a more
   interpretive process.},

   teachers designed, acted in and filmed mathematics classroom scenarios.
   The intent was to understand how preservice teachers perceived the
   process and how they worked through the video simulation process.
   Preservice teachers considered the technology use beneficial and valued
   learning from the experience, thus showing promise for incorporating
   video simulations in teacher education programmes.},

Abstract = {Lecturers of Calculus at Civil Engineering School at the Universitat
   Politecnica de Catalunya think Enginering students have to master
   mathematics to have a solid math foundation for their future studies and
   jobs as well as for developing and maintaining life-long mathematics
   learning skills. Our experience shows us that it is a difficult task but
   which can be achieved if we work to motivate and encourage students to
   understand, enjoy and learn for themselves this basic mathematics.
   In the present paper we introduce the last resources and materials that
   we have incorporated in the Calculus course taught during the first year
   of the Civil Engineering degree at the Escola Tecnica Superior
   d'Enginyers de Camins Canals i Ports de Barcelona in order to motivate
   and encourage students to study and learn mathematics for themselves.
   One of these last implementations is a set of face-to-face workshops
   which incorporates a televoting system. The other one consists in two
   collections of specific videos: one of them with the intention to
   motivate Civil Engineering students towards mathematics and the other
   one presents Calculus skills to enhance students' important mathematical
   concepts.
   The data collected for each of these resources allow us to think that
   these resources can really help us to achieve our purpose.},

Abstract = {In a crisis such as COVID-19 that struck the world in 2019, social and
   community activities are restricted, including in -person classes. On
   the one hand, these restrictions are aimed as a precautionary measure
   against the virus spread; on the other hand, this could lead to a lost
   generation without an educational process. Notwithstanding this, online
   learning through a video-sharing platform is envisaged as the best way
   to keep learning in this particular situation. However, students have
   their learning style preferences. While a video -based sharing platform
   is seen as the most representative way of facilitating self-directed
   learning, understanding the motivations driving the adoption is crucial.
   This paper investigates technical, social, and personal environments
   that motivate generation Z to utilise this tool for selfdirected
   learning, employing Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) as the theoretical
   lens. A total of 251 survey responses from this cohort were collected
   and analysed with a structural equation modelling approach. The findings
   reveal that perceived usefulness and content quality, peer influence,
   and self-efficacy and outcome from three perspectives, respectively,
   determine the adoption intention substantially by 67.1\%. These findings
   provide several important implications for video-sharing platform
   acceptance in terms of both research and practice. Limitations and
   future research directions are also discussed.},

Abstract = {This work presents an interactive self-learning tool named Technical
   Drawing Learning Tool-Level 2TDLT-L2for teaching manufacturing
   dimensioning to engineering students. The tool was designed for the
   students enrolled in the first year of the Bachelor in Management and
   Mechanical Engineering of the Universities of Brescia and Udine. It
   consists of a simple interactive tool, based on video and drawing
   animations, aimed at demonstrating the connection between real and
   simple machining processes and workpiece dimensions on technical
   drawing. TDLT-L2 is currently available in two versions: as a standalone
   application for Windows or Android based operating systems and as a set
   of interactive PDF documents. It was conceived as the first module of a
   package of tools that will be developed, based on the learning levels
   proposed in the Technical Drawing Evaluation GridTDEG. A preliminary
   evaluation of TDLT-L2 effectiveness was done involving the Management
   and Mechanical engineering students of Udine in some dimensioning
   exercises. The statistically considerations done on the obtained results
   confirmed the validity of the tool as a self-learning instrument with an
   average increase of marks of about 8.8\%. (c) 2016 Wiley Periodicals,

Abstract = {The BSc Biomedical Science award is designed to provide not only the
   knowledge but also the skills required to pursue a career as a
   biomedical scientist. Laboratory based practical sessions introduce
   students to these skills and aim to support the application of knowledge
   gained during lecture sessions to practice. The current teaching
   approach to laboratory based practical sessions and workshops is the
   provision of a workbook, introductory reading to support their
   preparation for the sessions and short visual instructions. Evaluation
   of summative reports produced by students for this module suggests that
   many students are not fully engaged and do not cultivate the ability to
   contextualise the procedures undertaken in the practical sessions. As a
   result these sessions are falling short of supporting the development of
   necessary skills such as problem solving, adaptability, initiative and
   self-awareness.
   Peer-assisted learning has been widely recognised as an effective
   strategy for teaching new concepts and a way of boosting student
   engagement, active learning and subject comprehension. This study
   investigated to what extent peer-developed ` skills' videos can support
   both the development of laboratory skills and an awareness of the
   application of these skills within the workplace.
   Students undertaking work-based placements designed and filmed a video
   of themselves and colleagues demonstrating the application of skills in
   the routine clinical environment. The situations and skills demonstrated
   were representative of those students will encounter upon graduation and
   employment. The videos were used to support delivery of a practical
   module consisting of a large cohort of 2nd year undergraduate students.
   The aim is to provide an active learning environment where students are
   able to recognise the close relationship between theoretical and
   practical aspects of the course and skills for application within the
   workplace setting.
   Perceptions of students after completing the module were captured using
   an electronic questionnaire and a focus group. Questionnaires revealed
   that students felt that the videos gave them greater motivation and
   confidence in class. Focus groups showed that students saw how
   peer-produced videos helped transition to work by showing what is
   expected of them in the workplace. Importantly, the videos enabled
   increased understanding, gave confidence and motivated students to study
   by engaging them in their subject.
   Overall the contextualisation of learning through the use peer-produced
   videos motivated students and provided currency for study through
   engagement in a real world dialogue with a ` virtual workplace'. This
   approach is now being extended to other modules and the scope of the
   videos changed to encompass other disciplines in healthcare science.},

Title = {The Association between Motivation, Affect, and Self-regulated Learning
   When Solving Problems},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {8},
Month = {AUG 8},
Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) skills are essential for learning during
   school years, particularly in complex problem-solving domains, such as
   biology and math. Although a lot of studies have focused on the
   cognitive resources that are needed for learning to solve problems in a
   self-regulated way, affective and motivational resources have received
   much less research attention. The current study investigated the
   relation between affect (i.e., Positive Affect and Negative Affect
   Scale), motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled motivation), mental
   effort, SRL skills, and problem-solving performance when learning to
   solve biology problems in a self-regulated online learning environment.
   In the learning phase, secondary education students studied
   video-modeling examples of how to solve hereditary problems, solved
   hereditary problems which they chose themselves from a set of problems
   with different complexity levels (i.e., five levels). In the posttest,
   students solved hereditary problems, self-assessed their performance,
   and chose a next problem from the set of problems but did not solve
   these problems. The results from this study showed that negative affect,
   inaccurate self-assessments during the posttest, and higher perceptions
   of mental effort during the posttest were negatively associated with
   problem-solving performance after learning in a self-regulated way.},

Abstract = {Combining cultural-historical and dialogical theoretical approaches, we
   understand language and the self as dialogically related dynamic
   phenomena. Learning is a dialogic activity shaped by language activity.
   The specific forms of language that learning activity takes are at the
   core of our research, leading to a form sensitive concept of
   professional development. It addresses societal contexts and others as
   formative and highlights voicings as concrete forms experienced by
   learning subjects, traceable in the dialogues on the subjects activity.
   The case study presents the learning activities of early childhood
   education (ECE) students and teachers within university level training.
   Video stimulated reflection and interviews were taken as qualitative
   research strategies to investigate the positioning processes within the
   dialogical self of students reflecting on their pedagogical practices.
   With the ``Teacher Interaction and Language Rating Scale{''}
   (Girolametto et al., 2000) we measured the interaction quality of the
   language activities in the classroom. The results illustrate the
   powerful dynamics of the dialogical learning activity: the kind of
   voicings emerging within the process of acquiring a `professional self
   and their effects on the self-transformative learning process. The
   ambivalence within learners' self is demonstrated, pointing to a genetic
   relationship between self-reflective and social positionings within the
   ECE community.},

Abstract = {Academic motivation is a pivotal factor in shaping students' educational
   trajectories. Mathematics education holds a unique position as a school
   subject, due to its influence on students' grade transitions and
   cognitive development at both basic and advanced levels. From March to
   May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project investigated how an
   AI-based learning assistant can enhance students' understanding of the
   subject matter through video-based learning. For this study, 275
   students were selected in the age range of 14-20 from two secondary
   (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany.
   The quantitative experiment tested the extent to which learners solve
   more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and retain it. Students
   were given a set of mathematical problems on an unknown topic to solve
   in 90 minutes. The test group used the AI assistant to ask questions,
   while the control group used only keyword searches. The results of the
   t-test indicated that the test group who used the AI Learning assistant
   in the advanced course achieved a significantly strong (Cohen's d=.63)
   increase in performance results (T(19)=- 2.82; p<.01). Conversely, the
   advanced course control group as well as both the test and control
   groups of the basic course(s) showed no significant improvements.},

Title = {Adaptations in Anatomy Education during COVID-19},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF KOREAN MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {36},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {Background: The impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has
   profoundly affected education, with most universities changing
   face-to-face classes to online formats. To adapt to the COVID-19
   pandemic situation, we adopted a blended learning approach to anatomy
   instruction that included online lectures, pre-recorded laboratory
   dissection videos, and 3D anatomy applications, with condensed offline
   cadaver dissection.
   Methods: We aimed to examine the learning outcomes of a newly adopted
   anatomy educational approach by 1) comparing academic achievement
   between the blended learning group (the 2020 class, 108 students) and
   the traditional classroom learning group (the 2019 class, 104 students),
   and 2) an online questionnaire survey on student preference on the
   learning method and reasons of preference.
   Results: The average anatomy examination scores of the 2020 class, who
   took online lectures and blended dissection laboratories, were
   significantly higher than those of the 2019 class, who participated in
   an offline lecture and dissection laboratories. The questionnaire survey
   revealed that students preferred online lectures over traditional large
   group lecture-based teaching because it allowed them to acquire
   increased self-study time, study according to their individual learning
   styles, and repeatedly review lecture videos.
   Conclusion: This study suggests that a blended learning approach is an
   effective method for anatomy learning, and the advantage may result from
   increased self-directed study through online learning.},

Abstract = {The virtual learning environment (VLE) in the Technical College of
   Yambol has been created using Moodle software platform and has been
   applied. In order to improve the quality of student training, this year
   start a project ``Introducing Interactive Teaching Methods in Inorganic
   Chemistry and Investigation the Effect on the Quality of Knowledge{''}.
   The project has the aim: to create e-learning data base of General and
   Inorganic Chemistry; to apply new interactive devices during lecture
   activities; innovative possibilities for self preparation of students as
   well as new assessments of acquire knowledge of students.
   The inspection of the opinion of students enrolled in e-learning
   supported courses, in the TC - Yambol, showed that 80\% of students
   support the idea of blended learning supported by Web-based e-learning
   materials, they found e-learning more interesting. Approximately 80\% of
   students gave positive answer about the e-quizzes for self preparation,
   followed by 70\% for video materials and the same range of 70\% for
   lecture presentations. We expect that through the creation of new
   approaches for teaching and self preparation will give novel
   possibilities to improve the quality of education furthered in the

Abstract = {Effective self-regulated learning in settings in which students can
   decide what tasks to work on, requires accurate self-assessment (i.e., a
   judgment of own level of performance) as well as accurate task selection
   (i.e., choosing a subsequent task that fits the current level of
   performance). Because self-assessment accuracy is often low,
   task-selection accuracy suffers as well and, consequently,
   self-regulated learning can lead to suboptimal learning outcomes. Recent
   studies have shown that a training with video modeling examples enhanced
   self-assessment accuracy on problem-solving tasks, but the training was
   not equally effective for every student and, overall, there was room for
   further improvement in self-assessment accuracy. Therefore, we
   investigated whether training with video examples followed by feedback
   focused on self-assessment accuracy would improve subsequent
   self-assessment and task-selection accuracy in the absence of the
   feedback. Experiment 1 showed, contrary to our hypothesis, that
   self-assessment feedback led to less accurate future self-assessments.
   In Experiment 2, we provided students with feedback focused on
   self-assessment accuracy plus information on the correct answers, or
   feedback focused on self-assessment accuracy, plus the correct answers
   and the opportunity to contrast those with their own answers. Again,
   however, we found no beneficial effect of feedback on subsequent
   self-assessment accuracy. In sum, we found no evidence that feedback on
   self-assessment accuracy improves subsequent accuracy. Therefore, future
   research should address other ways improving accuracy, for instance by
   taking into account the cues upon which students base their
   self-assessments.},

Abstract = {Purpose This study aimed to assess the feasibility and efficiency of
   self-learning with or without self-training (subjects performed scans on
   themselves) and telepresence instruction in focused cardiac ultrasound
   (FOCUS) education for medical students. Methods This study included 24
   medical students. The participants initially completed a written
   pre-test and were randomized into a video lecture (participants watched
   a video lecture) or self-training (participants watched a video lecture
   and self-performed FOCUS) group. After finishing self-learning, they
   completed a written post-test. Then they undertook a skill pre-test and
   a first perception survey. Telepresence instruction was then provided.
   Finally, they undertook a skill post-test and a second perception
   survey. Results The written post-test total scores were significantly
   higher than the pre-test total scores (P < 0.001). In the skill
   pre-test, the scores for the video lecture and self-training groups were
   not significantly different (P = 0.542). The skill post-test total
   scores were significantly higher than the skill pre-test total scores (P
   = 0.008). Forty-two percent of the video lecture group participants
   agreed that the video lecture was effective preparation for the skill
   pre-test, while all participants in the same group agreed that the
   combination of the video lecture and telepresence instruction was
   effective preparation for the skill post-test. Conclusion This study
   demonstrated the feasibility and efficiency of self-learning followed by
   telepresence instruction on FOCUS for medical students.},

Abstract = {Multimedia learning environments facilitate the construction of certain
   forms of representations and allow users to combine forms of
   representation that address different modalities. A promising approach
   entails having students construct representations of the domain. The
   process of constructing a representation elicits self-explanation
   effects and consists of dynamic iterations and interactions between the
   constructed representations and mental representations, and therefore
   helps students to refine and disambiguate their domain knowledge.
   Because mobile multimedia learning environments have enabled numerous
   new forms of presenting and communicating information, this study
   restores interest in the method of adopting mobile video conferencing in
   learning, and proposes its use in face-to-face collaborative learning of
   the first law of reflection in optics with the aim of harnessing the
   synergy of both communication modes. A total of 34 junior high school
   students participated in the study. The results showed that the
   participants acquired a new aspect of learning regarding the law of
   reflection, and their metacognitive awareness increased as a result of
   using the mobile video, which regulated their explorative learning
   process. This study provided an unprecedented and meaningful learning
   experience to students and stimulated teachers to explore the full
   potential of technologies around them in education.},

Abstract = {In education, a paradigm is shifting to a more innovative
   teaching-learning process. Specifically, this paradigm focuses on
   including video games in classrooms as a teaching resource intended to
   obtain a more entertaining, efficient, and pleasant quality education
   for students. The proposed research aims to analyze whether there are
   significant differences among users of video games on the benefits or
   harms they bring, especially in education, or there is a positive or
   negative general opinion, as other authors noted, on the influence of
   video games on users' behavior. To analyze the viewpoints on video
   games, first, we do an exploratory study through the literature. Then,
   we do a correlational survey study where Cluster Analysis and Multiple
   Correspondence Analysis are used. In this study, we took 400 Spanish
   consumers aged between 11 and 64 years without discrimination,
   regardless of sex. Among the results obtained, we can emphasize the
   creation of several groups with significant differences in their points
   of view, in some cases, very positive and in others more conservative.
   These results lead to conclude that the users' opinions about how video
   games can affect their self-growth are being more positive, opening
   doors for using video games in education and other sectors.},

Abstract = {Instructional videos for teaching second language (L2) vocabulary often
   feature an instructor onscreen. The instructor in the video may
   involuntarily produce beat gestures with their hands, as occurs in real
   teaching settings. Beat gestures highlight key information in speech by
   conveying the rhythm of the language, but do not themselves convey
   semantic meaning. However, little is known about how the instructor's
   beat gestures affect L2 vocabulary learning. We conducted two
   experiments on the effects of the instructor's purposeful (scripted)
   beat gestures in instructional videos that included an instructor and
   slides, with English L2 vocabulary as the topic. In Experiment 1, using
   a within-participant design, we tested the hypothesis that an
   instructor's gestures (beat gesture vs. no gesture) would improve
   learning performance. The results showed that the instructor's use of
   beat gestures increased learners' accuracy and reduced reaction time on
   an L2 learning performance test. In Experiment 2, using a
   between-participants design, we tested the assumption that the benefits
   of beat gestures in L2 vocabulary learning are in part due to reductions
   in cognitive load while learning. This assumption was supported by both
   a self-report measurement of cognitive load and electroencephalogram
   (EEG) data showing lower theta power and lower alpha power when the
   instructor used beat gestures. The results of this study have applied
   value for designing effective instructional videos on the topic of L2
   vocabulary learning.},

Abstract = {An implication of the current research on self-regulation is to
   implement the promotion of self-regulated learning in schools. Teachers
   can promote self-regulated learning either directly by teaching learning
   strategies or indirectly by arranging a learning environment that
   enables students to practise self-regulation. This study investigates
   teachers' direct and indirect promotion of self-regulated learning and
   its relation to the development of students' performance. Twenty German
   mathematics teachers with their overall 538 students (grade 9) were
   videotaped for a three-lesson unit on the Pythagorean Theorem. Students'
   mathematics performance was tested several times before and after the
   observed lessons. A low-inferent coding system was applied to assess the
   teachers' implicit or explicit instruction of cognitive strategies
   (e.g., organisation), metacognitive strategies (e.g., planning), and
   motivational strategies (e.g., resource management). High-inferent
   ratings were used to assess features of the learning environment that
   foster self-regulation. Results reveal that a great amount of strategy
   teaching takes place in an implicit way, whereas explicit strategy
   teaching and supportive learning environment are rare. The instruction
   of organisation strategies and some features of the learning environment
   (constructivism, transfer) relate positively to students' performance
   development. In contrast to implicit strategy instruction, explicit
   strategy instruction was associated with a gain in performance. These
   results reveal a discrepancy between the usefulness of explicit strategy
   instruction and its rare occurrence in classrooms.},

Abstract = {A key challenge in nursing education is how to teach the students
   clinical competencies effectively and to provide opportunities for
   practicing the fundamental nursing skills safely. The purpose of this
   study was to examine the competency scores of practicing a clinical
   skill and the satisfaction level of nursing students on three
   instructional methods using an action research: the online self-paced
   interactive video learning, demonstration-only method, and a video
   demonstration in class. Participants were both male and female nursing
   students enrolled in the Foundations of Nursing Course (N=26, 6 males
   and 20 females; mean age =19.42 +/- 0.50) and were evaluated at
   precycle, postcycle 1, and postcycle 2. Each cycle of inquiry was
   planned to address the problems quickly and efficiently through four
   steps: planning, acting, observing, and reflecting. A triangulation
   technique was employed for data collection using a competency skill
   evaluation checklist, a satisfaction questionnaire, and a focus group
   feedback questionnaire. A video was developed in the researcher's
   college pertaining to the practical skills. Each research cycle was
   successively built up on one another using the reflections and feedback
   from the students based on the previous cycle. The competency skills at
   various cycles did not demonstrate significant differences between three
   instructional methods, whereas satisfaction score was the highest with
   the online self-paced interactive video demonstration. Online video
   learning use as a supplement in nursing instruction is well supported
   and offers a promising alternative in teaching clinical skill compared
   with other teaching strategies. However, more rigorous studies are
   required to get further empirical evidence in replacing the
   demonstration method, for teaching nursing practical skill and in
   improving students' learning ability and competence.},

   perceived learning: From the social cognitive perspective of
   self-regulated learning},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {179},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {With the popularity of various video-centric asynchronous online
   courses, there is a trend of self-regulated online learning. Teaching
   presence is very important in such courses, and has a positive effect on
   learners' perceived learning. However, the association between teaching
   presence and perceived learning could be moderated by other factors, and
   little is known about how individual factors moderate the association.
   From the social cognitive perspective of self-regulated learning, the
   study examined the moderating effects of self-efficacy to complete an
   online course and online vigilance, which reflects individuals'
   permanent cognitive orientation to online-related stimuli and the
   disposition to be preoccupied with them constantly, on the relationship,
   and whether these moderating effects were moderated by inhibitory
   control. A cross-sectional design was adopted. Results found
   self-efficacy to complete an online course could significantly promote
   the positive association between teaching presence and perceived
   learning, and the moderating effect would be stronger with higher
   inhibitory control; online vigilance generally could not influence the
   relationship between teaching presence and perceived learning, except
   when inhibitory control was very high, in which case online vigilance
   could prominently intensify the relation-ship. The findings contribute
   to a better understanding of the association between teaching presence
   and perceived learning. Practical implications for educators to train
   students to be better self-regulated learners in asynchronous online
   courses, as well as teachers to improve course quality are also
   discussed.},

   for content based image retrieval (CBIR) of video frames similar to a
   query image from minimally invasive surgery (MIS) videos for surgical
   education. It extracts semantic descriptors from MIS video frames using
   a self-supervised deep learning model. It then employs an iterative
   query refinement strategy where in a binary classifier trained online
   based on relevance feedback from the user is used to iteratively refine
   the search results. Lastly, it uses an XAI technique to generate a
   saliency map that provides a visual explanation of why the system
   considers a retrieved image to be similar to the query image. We
   evaluated the proposed XAI-CBIR system on the public Cholec80 dataset
   containing 80 videos of minimally invasive cholecystectomy surgeries
   with encouraging results.},

Abstract = {Scholars in teacher education have observed that the dichotomy between
   teachers' professional and personal identities could restrain their
   pursuits of adopting innovative approaches in the classroom. At the same
   time, adopting new pedagogical approaches often contests teachers'
   professional identities and confidence. In this paper, we examine a
   graduate course on game-based learning, designed for professionals such
   as teachers and practitioners. While video games and game-based learning
   have gained attention from researchers and practitioners, they may pose
   challenges for many teachers. We observed that this course could provide
   opportunities for participants to construct their narratives in relation
   to gaming and learning over time. They may also reinterpret and extend
   their cultural worlds as part of their teacher identity. We conclude
   that enabling teachers to confront tensions and risks of adopting
   unfamiliar practices could help them transform their self-narratives.
   This study could inform design considerations to support teachers'
   adopting innovative pedagogies in future research and practices on
   professional learning. It is also important to acknowledge that the
   study had limited participant diversity and representativeness. There is
   the need for further exploration of teachers with different backgrounds
   and experiences in order to better understand the challenges and
   opportunities of adopting innovative pedagogies.},

Title = {The Impact of Manuscript Learning vs. Video Learning on a Surgeon's
   Confidence in Performing a Difficult Procedure},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN SURGERY},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 12},
Abstract = {Introduction: Operative surgical videos are a popular educational
   resource, not commonly a part of a peer-reviewed article. We wanted to
   evaluate the impact of either reading a peer-reviewed manuscript or
   watching an operative video on a surgeon's confidence in performing a
   complex case.
   Methods: Pediatric surgeons and fellows were asked to complete an
   initial questionnaire to assess their confidence (formulated as a score)
   in the diagnosis and operative repair of anal stenosis and rectal
   atresia.
   Results: Of 101 pediatric surgeons and fellows, 52 (51\%) were
   randomized into a ``manuscript{''} group and 49 (49\%) into a
   ``video{''} group. The mean confidence before the intervention was the
   same in the two groups (6.4 vs. 6.6). Attending surgeons started with
   more confidence than trainees (7.1 vs. 5.3, p < 0.001). In the
   manuscript group, the average confidence increased to 7.7 (p = 0.005),
   and in the video group the average confidence increased to 7.9 (p =
   0.001) globally. Trainees in the video group significantly improved
   their confidence to a score of 6.6 (p = 0.035), as did attending
   surgeons to 8.5 (p = 0.01). In the manuscript group, only attendings
   significantly improved their confidence by 1.5-8.3 (p < 0.001), whereas
   trainees did not with a difference of 1.3 (p = 0.194). When considering
   experience level, physicians who reported never having performed this
   surgery improved only by reading the manuscript (3.9-6.2) (p = 0.004),
   not by watching the video (5.4-6.6) (p = 0.106). Surgeons with
   experience doing this operation (> 5 times) did not improve their
   confidence by reading the manuscript (p = 0.10), nor by watching the
   video (p = 0.112).
   Conclusion: Reviewing either a detailed manuscript or operative video on
   the surgical management of rectal atresia and anal stenosis demonstrated
   a significant increase in self-reported confidence. Trainees benefitted
   the most from operative videos, whereas experienced surgeons did not
   improve their confidence by reading the manuscript nor watching the
   video.},

Abstract = {A group of English as Foreign Language (EFL) students who participated
   in this study were found to be poor in comprehending spoken English and
   felt unconfident to practice their spoken English because of their lack
   of active vocabulary knowledge. This study discussed the challenge of
   activating their oral vocabulary using the technology called
   Native-Speaker Video Clips with Subtitle (NSVCS). The students chose
   their own sub-topics freely and practiced them using the Self Regulated
   Learning (SRL) strategies in the period of 16 weeks focusing on 6 main
   topics, namely: Islam, Animal, Human, Sport, Agriculture and Economics.
   Improvement in fluency, understanding, pronunciation, stressing, and
   intonation was analysed based on their Classroom Performance (CP)
   records using tape script, which was only done on one medium achievement
   sample with the beginning, the middle and the last topics. The findings
   showed that the students adjusted their tongues to the new vocabulary
   very well and were able to improve their overall fluency, understanding,
   pronunciation, stressing, and intonation gradually.},

Title = {A self-supervised learning network for remote heart rate measurement},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {228},
Month = {MAR 31},
Abstract = {The rPPG technology is a facial video-based non-contact physiological
   parameter detection technology, which has been widely used in the
   measurement of heart rate, respiration, blood oxygen and other
   physiological parameters. Most of the current research hotspots in this
   field are based on deep learning methods, which typically necessitate a
   significant amount of data samples for training the neural network to
   obtain accurate measurement results. However, the high cost required to
   label the data samples limits the diffusion and application of the
   technique. To address the above problems, we propose a new
   self-supervised aimed at acquiring the ability to estimate rPPG signals
   from facial videos, eliminating the need for labeled data. The framework
   expands the unlabeled video samples into multiple positive/negative
   samples and uses contrast learning to obtain an rPPG signal estimation
   network, which outputs the corresponding rPPG signals of face videos. To
   promote the convergence of network training, a new frequency loss
   function is designed. This function can effectively shorten the distance
   between the frequencies of similar sample signals and push the distance
   between the frequencies of different sample signals far away, so as to
   enhance the frequency consistency between sample signals and make the
   model easier to learn the differences between different sample pairs.
   Our method is evaluated on four standard rPPG datasets, the experimental
   results show that the accuracy is close to the current best supervised
   method, and is superior to the previous self-supervised method without
   using any labeled data.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Virtual reality-based simulators have the potential to become
   an essential part of surgical education. To make full use of this
   potential, they must be able to automatically recognize activities
   performed by users and assess those. Since annotations of trajectories
   by human experts are expensive, there is a need for methods that can
   learn to recognize surgical activities in a data-efficient way. Methods:
   We use self-supervised training of deep encoder-decoder architectures to
   learn representations of surgical trajectories from video data. These
   representations allow for semi-automatic extraction of features that
   capture information about semantically important events in the
   trajectories. Such features are processed as inputs of an unsupervised
   surgical activity recognition pipeline. Results: Our experiments
   document that the performance of hidden semi-Markov models used for
   recognizing activities in a simulated myomectomy scenario benefits from
   using features extracted from representations learned while training a
   deep encoder-decoder network on the task of predicting the remaining
   surgery progress. Conclusion: Our work is an important first step in the
   direction of making efficient use of features obtained from deep
   representation learning for surgical activity recognition in settings
   where only a small fraction of the existing data is annotated by human
   domain experts and where those annotations are potentially incomplete.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, people are more predisposed to being self-taught due to the
   availability of online information. With digitalization, information
   appears not only in its conventional state, as blogs, articles,
   newspapers, or e-books, but also in more interactive and enticing ways.
   Video games have become a transmission vehicle for information and
   knowledge, but they require specific treatment in respect of their
   presentation and the way in which users interact with them. This
   treatment includes usability guidelines and heuristics that provide
   video game properties that are favorable to a better user experience,
   conducive to captivating the user and to assimilating the content. In
   this research, usability guidelines and heuristics, complemented with
   recommendations from educational video game studies, were gathered and
   analyzed for application to a video game for English language learning
   called EnLang4All, which was also developed in the scope of this project
   and evaluated in terms of its reception by users.},

Abstract = {This study investigates how self-regulated learning phases are related
   to collaborative engagement in two different collaborative task
   conditions. It integrates SRL theory and the concept of engagement,
   including interaction in collaboration, as key characteristics of
   engagement. Forty-four second-year teacher education students worked in
   groups during a 7-week math didactic course. We collected 84 h of video
   recordings and coded the group's cognitive and socioemotional
   interaction and three phases of self-regulation within interaction,
   including forethought, performance and reflection. After that we
   analyzed the relationship between the interaction types representing
   collaborative engagement and SRL phases within two learning tasks. The
   results show that collaborative engagement did not differ between
   teacher-led and student-led tasks in terms of the interaction types.
   However, the results showed that the SRL phases occurred differently
   within cognitive and socioemotional interaction types when the two task
   conditions were compared. Findings concerning teacher-led tasks showed
   invariance in the occurrence of SRL phases across the task and
   highlighted the relationship between socioemotional interaction and the
   forethought phase. Additionally, findings concerning the student-led
   tasks showed systematic changes in the distribution of phases of SRL
   across sessions in all interaction types. Our results' theoretical and
   methodological implications for collaborative engagement research are
   discussed. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Video-based modeling examples and comparative self-explanation prompts
   for teaching a complex problem-solving strategy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {40},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1852-1870},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: In example-based learning, examples are often combined with
   generative activities, such as comparative self-explanations of example
   cases. Comparisons induce heavy demands on working memory, especially in
   complex domains. Hence, only stronger learners may benefit from
   comparative self-explanations. While static text-based examples can be
   compared easily, this is challenging for transient video-based modelling
   examples used in complex domains because simultaneous processing of two
   videos is not feasible. Objectives: To allow for such comparisons, we
   combined video-based modelling examples with static representations
   (i.e., summarizing tables) of the observed optimal and a suboptimal
   solution of the problem-solving process. A comparative self-explanation
   prompt asked learners to compare the different solution approaches. Our
   study investigated the impact of video-based modelling examples versus
   independent problem-solving on cognitive load and problem-solving skill
   development. Moreover, we investigated the effects of comparative versus
   sequential self-explanation prompts, depending on learners' prior
   knowledge. Methods: In an experiment, 118 automotive apprentices learned
   a car malfunction diagnosis strategy. Apprentices were divided into
   three groups: (1) modelling examples with comparative self-explanation
   prompts, (2) modelling examples with sequential prompts, and (3) no
   examples or prompts. Diagnostic knowledge and skills were assessed
   before and after the intervention. Cognitive load was measured
   retrospectively. Results and conclusions: Despite no observed effects on
   cognitive load, modelling examples enhanced diagnostic knowledge and
   diagnostic skills with scaffolds, though not independent diagnostic
   skills without scaffolds. The need for more practice opportunities to
   foster independent diagnostic skills is assumed. Additionally,
   comparative prompts seem promising for learners with higher prior
   knowledge. Take aways Video-based modelling examples were more
   beneficial for learning than practising to apply the diagnostic
   strategy. Static representations allow for comparisons of video examples
   and comparative prompts are promising for learners with higher prior
   knowledge (cf. expertise-reversal effect). Further research, especially
   on the effects on cognitive load, is necessary.},

Title = {Effects of instructional conditions and experience on student
   reflection: a video annotation study},
Journal = {HIGHER EDUCATION RESEARCH \& DEVELOPMENT},

Abstract = {This article reports on the findings of a study that investigated the
   effects of instructional conditions and prior experience on students'
   self-reflection. The study was conducted with the use of a video
   annotation tool that was used by undergraduate performing arts students
   to reflect on their video-recorded performances. The study shows a
   consistent positive effect of previous experience with the video
   annotation tool for engagement with reflection. Graded instructional
   conditions with feedback had a positive effect on increasing higher
   order reflections particularly for students with prior experience with
   the video annotation tool for reflective purposes. The finding suggests
   that when including reflection in the curriculum, it is important to
   consider introducing it at a program or degree level rather than
   individual courses in order to provide an opportunity for students to
   gain experience with reflection and any particular tool that is used
   (e.g., a video annotation tool). Furthermore, reflective tasks should be
   scaffolded into the curriculum with ample opportunity for formative
   feedback and summative assessment in order to encourage higher order
   thinking and foster students' metacognitive awareness and monitoring for
   increased goal-setting and acknowledgement of the motive or effect of
   their observed behavior.},

Abstract = {More than a decade ago, evidence-based recommendations emerged regarding
   what students of information systems (IS) management education should
   learn and how should they learn it. Although these recommendations for
   how IS management should be taught remain valid, they need to be updated
   to account for recent advances in technologies that enable multimedia
   learning. Promoters of such technologies promise enhanced cognitive and
   behavioural outcomes, but this promise remains unreached, reflecting the
   underdeveloped multimedia-enabled learning literature. To help attain
   this promise and rejuvenate the literature of multimedia learning, we
   offer a roadmap for new areas of research that would inform the design
   and use of a novel form of multimedia materials: narrative animated
   videos (NAVs). NAVs represent a form of self-determined learning that
   features immersive, story-based content. We argue that their use will
   intrinsically motivate users to process the materials to completion,
   thereby enhancing cognitive and behavioural outcomes, and thus
   catalysing the effectiveness of the team-based learning and
   self-regulated learning modes for problem-based learning (PBL) delivery
   of IS management education. This compelling roadmap corresponds to
   meaningful IS research because it centres on a topic that the IS
   literature has long examined-the role of user motivation-and because its
   theoretical contributions invite specific paths of research for
   informing the design of the PBL delivery of IS management education
   within an information systems artefact.},

Abstract = {Self-assessment has been shown to have positive effects on students'
   self-regulated learning strategies and academic achievement. However,
   self-assessment and self-assessment instruction are under-researched
   areas among students with intellectual disability. This data-driven
   qualitative study aimed at examining the self-assessment expressions
   students with intellectual disability documented in their learning
   diaries and how the teacher and teaching assistants used video
   recordings to facilitate students' self-assessments in one Finnish
   special needs education class. The naturally occurring research data
   consisted of both students' tablet-based learning diaries (N = 6) and
   video recordings of students' self-assessment situations (N = 17). The
   results show that students' self-assessment expressions varied from
   short and vague expressions to argumentative and reflective assessments.
   The use of video recordings served various functions, such as directing
   and instructing students, demonstrating assessment and providing
   feedback. The outcomes of this study demonstrate how the self-assessment
   practices of students with intellectual disabilities can be facilitated
   by using video.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Patients have responded in variable ways to pain science
   education about the psychosocial correlates of pain. To improve the
   effectiveness of pain education approaches, this study qualitatively
   explored participants' perceptions of and responses to pain science
   education. Methods: We conducted a qualitative content analysis of
   interviews with fifteen, adult patients (73.3\% female) who had recently
   attended a first visit to a chronic pain clinic and watched a pain
   science educational video. Results: Participants thought it was
   important to improve their and healthcare providers' understanding of
   their pain. They viewed the video favorably, learned information from
   it, and thought it could feasibly facilitate communication with their
   healthcare providers, but, for many participants, the video either did
   not answer their questions and/or raised more questions. Participants'
   responses to the video included negative and positive emotions and were
   influenced by their need for confirmation that their pain was real and
   personal relevance of the pain science content. Conclusion: Study
   results support the feasibility and value of delivering pain science
   education via video and increase our understanding of patients'
   perceptions of and responses to pain science education. The video's
   triggering of emotional responses warrants additional research.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a mobile device for

   researchers taught participants to access video models on a mobile
   device in order to independently complete three tasks. Then, in
   baseline, researchers asked participants to complete a novel skill and
   collected data on their performance. Intervention involved allowing
   access to the mobile device. Data were collected on participants'
   ability to pick up and navigate the device as well as their ability to
   complete the novel skill following self-instruction (i.e., replacing
   computer memory). Two participants independently initiated the use of
   the mobile device to self-instruct, and one participant required verbal
   prompting to initiate using the device. All participants acquired the
   novel skill replacing computer memory by self-instruction. (C) 2015

Title = {Bringing simulation to the classroom using an unfolding video patient
   scenario: A quasi-experimental study to examine student satisfaction,
   self-confidence, and perceptions of simulation design},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {86},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background: Teaching strategies to promote experiential learning in the
   classroom are important to facilitate students' clinical reasoning
   abilities. Using video to simulate unfolding patient scenarios in the
   classroom has the potential to engage students through active learning
   and to enhance their ability to connect theory to practice.
   Objectives: Study objectives were to: (1) Evaluate nursing students'
   satisfaction and self-confidence in learning and perceptions of the
   design of a simulated patient scenario delivered via video in the
   classroom and (2) Compare findings to students' satisfaction,
   self-confidence, and perceptions of the design of prior high-fidelity
   simulation experiences in the laboratory.
   Design: A quasi-experimental approach was used.
   Setting: The study setting was a nursing classroom at a University in
   the southeast United States.
   Participants: Convenience sampling was utilized and 54 students in their
   final semester of a pre-licensure baccalaureate nursing program
   participated.
   Methods: The intervention was an unfolding video patient scenario
   delivered in the classroom. Prior to the intervention, participants
   completed two measurement tools to collect information about their
   satisfaction, self-confidence, and perceptions of the design of prior
   high-fidelity simulations. After the intervention, these tools were
   administered again to collect data about the video simulation experience
   in the classroom.
   Results: Participants had a higher level of satisfaction (p = 0.002) and
   self-confidence (p < 0.001) following the classroom intervention than
   for prior high-fidelity simulations in the laboratory. Student
   perceptions of the simulation design were more favorable for the
   classroom intervention than for prior laboratory simulations (p <
   0.001).
   Conclusions: Use of unfolding video patient scenarios in the classroom
   can promote student engagement in learning. Nurse educators should
   consider this teaching strategy that provides students with
   opportunities to connect and apply classroom content to patient care.},

Abstract = {Despite the great progress in video understanding made by deep
   convolutional neural networks, feature representation learned by
   existing methods may be biased to static visual cues. To address this
   issue, we propose a novel method to suppress static visual cues
   ((SVC)-V-2) based on probabilistic analysis for self-supervised video
   representation learning. In our method, video frames are first encoded
   to obtain latent variables under standard normal distribution via
   normalizing flows. By modelling static factors in a video as a random
   variable, the conditional distribution of each latent variable becomes
   shifted and scaled normal. Then, the less-varying latent variables along
   time are selected as static cues and suppressed to generate
   motion-preserved videos. Finally, positive pairs are constructed by
   motion-preserved videos for contrastive learning to alleviate the
   problem of representation bias to static cues. The less-biased video
   representation can be better generalized to various downstream tasks.
   Extensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks demonstrate that
   the proposed method outperforms the state of the art when only single
   RGB modality is used for pre-training.},

Abstract = {Uncertain environmental conditions that impact children's cognitive
   abilities and self-learning capacities have created a number of
   challenges for student education today. These challenges require the
   attention of the researchers. Consequently, this paper investigates the
   influence of cognitive talents and self-regulated learning on students'
   academic performance in Vietnamese educational institutions. This study
   also examines the moderating effect of educational psychology on the
   relationships between mental abilities, self-regulated learning, and
   learning performance in Vietnamese educational institutions. The article
   collected primary data from chosen students via questionnaires. In
   addition to employing the smart-PLS statistical technique to analyze the
   reliability and validity of the questions and variables, the study also
   tested its hypotheses. The results suggested that cognitive ability and
   self-regulated learning favorably influence academic success. The data
   also demonstrated that educational psychology strongly moderates the
   relationship between mental talents, self-regulated learning, and
   students' academic achievement in Vietnamese educational institutions.
   The article aids in developing regulations for increasing student
   performance by enhancing their cognitive and learning capacities.},

Abstract = {Three similarly designed interventions were evaluated in which
   preservice and in-service primary school teachers received video
   feedback using structured viewing guides in order to improve the

   and observations show that after intervention, the teachers in
   experimental groups, who received structured video feedback, practiced
   significantly more of the teaching behaviours targeted than the teachers

   on domain-specific effective teaching behaviours can be a powerful
   contribution towards raising teachers' quality of instruction. (C) 2017

Title = {Effects of different online peer-feedback approaches on students'
   performance skills, motivation and self-efficacy in a dance course},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {96},
Pages = {55-71},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {It has become common practice to video record students' in-class dance
   moves. Such a teaching strategy is able to help students reflect on
   their dance performance by providing them with visualized feedback.
   Therefore, in this study, an online peer-feedback system for dance
   education has been developed in order to compare the effects of
   different modes of online peer-feedback on students' dance skills
   performance, learning motivation, self efficacy, peer review quality,
   peer assessment correctness, and online learning behaviors. Moreover,
   interviews were also conducted to elicit the students' opinions
   regarding this teaching method. The participants were 100 college
   students from three classes who learned with different online
   peer-feedback modes: videos with peer comments, videos with peer
   ratings, and videos with a mixed mode (i.e., peer ratings plus peer
   comments). A 12-week experiment was conducted to evaluate the
   performances of the three approaches. The experimental results show
   that, in terms of dance skills, peer ratings could improve the students'
   group performance, while the mixed mode improved individuals' learning
   performance. In terms of learning motivation and self-efficacy, the
   correlation analysis shows that the students' intrinsic motivation,
   self-efficacy and dance skill performance were positively correlated.
   Via analyzing the peer feedback content, it was found that the feedback
   provided by the mixed mode group was of better quality than that
   provided by the ``peer comments{''} group; that is, the former provided
   more detailed feedback to individuals than the latter. Furthermore, it
   was found that the scores provided by the mixed mode group were highly
   related to those provided by the teachers, while those provided by the
   ``peer ratings{''} group were not. The online user behavior analysis
   further shows that the integration of peer commenting and peer rating is
   able to promote students' willingness to participate in online learning
   activities. The interview results also confirm these findings. To sum
   up, the integration of both peer rating and peer comments is an
   effective approach that can meet the students' expectations and help
   them improve their dance skills, peer-feedback quality, peer-scoring
   correctness as well as their willingness to participate in online
   learning activities. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Observational learning is an effective pedagogical approach that can
   influence students' motor skill development at every level of physical
   education (PE). This study aimed to systematically summarize the
   evidence on observational learning for motor skill learning in PE and to
   generalize the evidence on the effect of model formats and verbal cues
   during observational learning. An electronic search of eight databases
   was conducted. Eighteen studies were included and their methodological
   quality was assessed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale.
   Best evidence synthesis (BES) was used to assess levels of evidence.
   Strong evidence supported the effect of observational learning on
   students' motor skill learning compared to students who did not
   participate in observational learning. Moderate evidence suggested that
   there is no significant difference in the effectiveness of observing an
   expert model compared to a self-model. Conflicting evidence was
   identified for the effect of the presence of verbal cues compared to the
   absence of verbal cues during observational learning. The results
   suggest that observational learning is useful for students' motor skill
   learning in PE. Given the influences of potential factors, we recommend
   that future studies investigate how observational learning interacts
   with verbal cues on students' motor skill learning.},

Title = {Detecting fluctuations in student engagement and retention during video
   lectures using electroencephalography},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {54},
Number = {6},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Video lectures are commonly used in online and flipped courses, but
   students often find it challenging to stay engaged and retain lecture
   content. The current study examined to what extent the power of
   electroencephalography (EEG) brain activity in the theta (4-7 Hz), alpha
   (8-12 Hz) and beta (13-20 Hz) bands can dynamically capture fluctuations
   of student engagement and retention throughout pre-recorded lectures.
   EEG activity was recorded from 33 college students throughout four
   video-based chemistry lectures. In-video probes were used to assess both
   student engagement and content retention at random moments during the
   video. Our findings reveal that there are significant fluctuations in
   self-reported engagement throughout pre-recorded lectures. Further,
   among the three frequency bands that were tested, only alpha power
   closely tracked fluctuations in self-reported engagement at the
   individual student level. In-lecture fluctuations in engagement were
   associated with content retention, but content retention itself was not
   well captured by EEG activity in any of the frequency bands that were
   examined. These findings suggest that the design of video lectures
   should consider fluctuations in student engagement and potentially
   incorporate self-reported and physiological indicators of engagement.
   Future research should further investigate how EEG and other
   physiological engagement indicators can be used in real time to
   personalize online instruction. Practitioner NotesWhat is already known
   about this topicStudents often find it challenging to stay engaged
   during online lectures and retain lecture content.Measuring engagement
   and retention throughout an online lecture (rather than only at its end)
   is important but challenging because it requires the insertion of
   in-lecture questions that interrupt the learning
   process.Electroencephalography (EEG) could potentially provide a
   continuous and implicit measure of engagement and retention throughout
   online lectures. What this paper addsSelf-reported engagement tends to
   gradually decrease throughout the duration of video lectures with
   substantial variation both within and between students.Fluctuations in
   student engagement are predictive of content retention throughout video
   lectures.EEG power in the alpha band (8-12 Hz) dynamically tracks
   fluctuations in student engagement.EEG power in the alpha band
   significantly predicts overall lecture engagement as well as learning
   confidence. However, EEG power might not be sensitive to variations in
   post-lecture test performance. Implications for practice and/or
   policyThe design of online lectures should take into consideration the
   dynamic and idiosyncratic nature of student engagement.In-video
   self-report probes and EEG power measures can be useful sources of
   information on students' level of engagement during online lectures.It
   should be further investigated whether EEG and other physiological
   indicators of engagement can be used in real time to personalize online
   instruction.},

Title = {Pre-class mode ``flipped{''} again: Making videos instead of just
   watching them},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {6},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {`` Flipped classroom{''} has subverted the traditional classroom
   teaching model and is believed to have a positive impact on knowledge
   acquisition and skill training for higher education students. The pre
   -class learning phase is considered a key factor in the success of
   flipped classrooms. However, currently, the pre -class learning phase of
   flipped classrooms mainly relies on video watching, which makes students
   passive receivers. Teachers need to invest a lot of time and resources
   in developing online videos, which greatly increases students' learning
   time and tasks. This also hinders the promotion of this teaching model.
   This study designs a pre -active learning strategy based on student
   participation in video production and a flipped classroom teaching
   model, and uses questionnaire surveys and interviews to observe
   students' reactions, explore its impact on students' satisfaction, and
   empirically analyze the path it affects students' satisfaction. We found
   that in the pre -class phase, the greater the ease of use and usefulness
   perceived by students in video production, the higher the students'
   satisfaction. Perceived enjoyment and perceived value are important
   intermediary paths. In addition, based on the research results, this
   study proposes suggestions for a flipped classroom teaching model based
   on video production. The results of this study will provide important
   references for the pre -class learning phase of flipped classrooms.},

Abstract = {How can a blended classroom make room for a better and closer
   relationship between the teacher and his/her students, and how can this
   relationship gain engagement in the students' learning?
   The flipped learning model has brought many teachers across the globe to
   make their own instructional videos and make these as their students'
   homework. This presentation will show how the students' self-assessment
   of their learning process in connection with their online activities
   will impact the time teachers and students spend in the classroom
   together.
   In the teaching model presented here, the students fill out a digital
   self-assessment form where they are explaining for the teacher the
   learning outcome of the activities they've done on the outside of the
   classroom, and not to forget - using their own words trying to explain
   where they need help to move forward. In this way the teacher knows
   where each students needs guidance, which impact how the teacher will
   meet the students in the classroom.
   This self-assessment gives:
   1) the student a chance to reflect upon their own learning;
   2) the teacher a sign on where the students' are in learning process;
   and
   3) a common ground from where the teacher and student together can find
   the way forward.
   The combination of online communication and H2H (human-to-human)
   communication between the teacher and the students builds up a more
   transparent environment, where the teacher over time builds up the
   students' trust in that the teacher will use his/her insight in the
   students' misunderstandings or misconceptions to guide them forward in
   the right direction, and where these misconceptions can be used as
   opportunities to a deeper understanding.},

Abstract = {This paper presents the novel app MILAGE Learn+ Launcher for smartphones
   and tablets where students can solve mathematical problems outside the
   classroom or at home and increase the time they spend learning and
   practicing mathematics. This app is a tool for learning mathematics that
   provides a set of problems organized according to the curriculum. It was
   designed for upper secondary schools but it can be used for other levels
   and subjects too. This tool is innovative in the introduction of self
   and peer evaluation for students of secondary schools in a gamification
   process of solving problems. With this app students solve mathematical
   problems and they have immediate feedback that is used for
   self-evaluation. After solving the problem and doing the self-evaluation
   the student can choose to watch a concise or detailed video to study the
   problem resolution. The concise video shows the steps need to solve the
   problem. The detailed video shows in more detail, including background
   information that may help low achiever students understand the
   resolution of that problem. In this way, the student can watch the video
   as many times as those needed to learn how to solve that problem. This
   is a step for the inclusion of low achiever students in the process of
   learning mathematics. This app also provides three levels of problems:
   beginners, intermediate and advanced to accommodate the low achievers
   and also motivate top performers students to use the app. The student
   can also at anytime evaluate his peers. In this way, the student can
   also study again problems of a certain topic when he is evaluating the
   resolution of a problem solved by another student. In this way, the
   teacher can also check the self and peer evaluation of his students and
   has feedback about students' achievements.},

   and subsequent explanation generation? The moderated mediating roles of
   motivation and explanation characteristics},
Journal = {ACTIVE LEARNING IN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Finding effective ways to improve students' learning from video lectures
   will not only improve online education efficacy, it will also play an
   important role in the digital transformation of education. Generating
   written explanations has shown some benefits for learning, and peer
   presence may be an implementation-related boundary condition. This study
   tested the impacts of virtual peer presence (presence vs. absence) and
   generative tasks (generating explanations vs. no generation) on
   students' learning in a video-based learning context. Students'
   attention, meta-comprehension accuracy, motivation, cognitive load,
   learning achievements, and explanation characteristics were measured.
   Results showed some benefits of having a virtual peer, and of generating
   written explanations on students' learning. Moreover, mediating analyses
   revealed the mediating role of motivation between peer presence and
   learning achievement, and moderated mediating analyses revealed the
   moderating role of explanation characteristics between peer presence and
   motivation. Our findings not only extend the understanding of the
   positive effects of generating written explanations in video-based
   learning contexts, they also provide implications for improving
   students' learning from video lectures as well as optimizing online
   video lectures.},

Title = {Nursing students' knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy in blended learning
   of cardiopulmonary resuscitation: a randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {19},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background Although various forms of online education are on the rise
   worldwide, effects of such innovative approach are yet to be validated.
   This study analyzes whether blended learning cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR) education that integrates e-learning and
   face-to-face education is effective in improving nursing students'
   knowledge, attitude, and self-efficacy. Methods A randomized controlled
   design was used. The participants of this study were 120 nursing
   students randomly assigned to the intervention group (n = 60) or the
   control (n = 60). The intervention group was trained using a blended
   learning CPR education program. Self report questionnaires with
   knoweldge, attitude, and self-efficacy were all used in the pre and post
   intervention. Differences before and after the education of each group
   were analyzed with a paired t-test, and the differences between the two
   groups were analyzed with ANCOVA with knowledge as the covariate.
   Results The findings indicated that the intervention group had
   significantly higher knowledge scores (intervention: 16.40 +/- 1.56,
   control: 6.46 +/- 2, p < .001), and emotional attitude (intervention:
   40.85 +/- 8.01, control: 36.05 +/- 6.87, p = .002) about CPR than the
   control group, but other outcomes did not differ between groups.
   Conclusions In this monocentric study, a blended learning CPR program
   that integrated videos and face to face lecture was found effective in
   improving nursing students' knowledge and attitudes regarding CPR.},

Abstract = {Video game play is remarkably ubiquitous in today's society given its
   recent emergence only in the late 1950s. While this fast evolution could
   exemplify the power of play, video games exploit but also extend other
   types of play. Here, we review a classification of the ecosystem of
   video games useful in the emerging field of the cognitive neuroscience
   of video games. We then discuss how video games may leverage different
   play types, considering first locomotor-rotational, object, and social
   play before highlighting the importance of role, rule, and pretend play
   in video games. With an eye toward comparative studies of the neural
   bases of play across species, we discuss whether video games may fulfil
   the five criteria from Burghardt (2005) to identify play. Finally, in
   line with play's possible preparatory role for adulthood, we review the
   positive impact on cognition and future learning of action-like video
   games. Highlighting that not all video games have this impact, we note
   more granular hypotheses about the biological functions of play are to
   be encouraged.},

Title = {Holistic feedback approach with video and peer discussion under teacher
   supervision},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {17},
Month = {SEP 29},
Abstract = {Background: High quality feedback is vital to learning in medical
   education but many students and teachers have expressed dissatisfaction
   on current feedback practices. Lack of teachers' insight into students'
   feedback requirements may be a key, which might be addressed by giving
   control to the students with student led feedback practices. The
   conceptual framework was built on three dimensions of learning theory by
   Illeris and Vygotsky's zone of proximal development and scaffolding. We
   introduced a feedback session with self-reflection and peer feedback in
   the form of open discussion on video-recorded student performances under
   teacher's guidance. The aims of this qualitative study were to explore
   students' perception on this holistic feedback approach and to
   investigate ways of maximising effective feedback and learning.
   Methods: Semi-structured interviews were used to gather data which were
   evaluated using a thematic analytical approach. The participants were
   third year medical students of Imperial College London on clinical
   placements at Hillingdon Hospital.
   Results: Video based self-reflection helped some students to identify
   mistakes in communication and technical skills of which they were
   unaware prior to the session. Those who were new to video feedback found
   their expected self-image different to that of their actual image on
   video, leading to some distress. However many also identified that
   mistakes were not unique to themselves through peer videos and learnt
   from both model performances and from each other's mistakes. Balancing
   honest feedback with empathy was a challenge for many during peer
   discussion. The teacher played a vital role in making the session a
   success by providing guidance and a supportive environment.
   Conclusions: This study has demonstrated many potential benefits of this
   holistic feedback approach with video based self-reflection and peer
   discussion with students engaging at a deeper cognitive level than the
   standard descriptive feedback.},

Abstract = {A review of related research found the use of recorded lecture videos
   (RLVs) in undergraduate mathematics to be negatively correlated with
   academic performance. To investigate this correlation, an initial study
   found students' regular RLV use to be linked to surface approaches to
   learning. The present study continued this investigation and was
   informed by cognitive research on the use of television which suggested
   framing learning using RLVs as a dual process system operating within a
   framework of self-regulated learning. Interviews were conducted with
   some initial study participants focusing on students' judgements of
   their learning when using RLVs. A dual-process theoretical lens was used
   to analyse interview transcripts and determine the nature of student
   thinking processes. Overall, regular RLV users were found significantly
   more likely to exhibit judgements of learning associated with achieving
   `feelings of rightness'. Across both studies, evidence suggests regular
   RLV use, overall, is depressing student learning.},

Title = {STUDENTS' EXPERIENCES OF 2D AND 360° VIDEOS WITH OR WITHOUT A LOW-COST
   VR HEADSET: AN EXPERIMENTAL STUDY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {309-329},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This case study examines students' affective responses to
   and relationships with two-dimensional (2D) and 360 degrees videos that
   were experienced with or without low-cost virtual reality (VR) headsets.
   Background The prior research on low-cost VR technology is scant.
   Schools and universities are not financially able to purchase tens or
   hundreds of expensive inbuilt VR headsets. Therefore, we recommend an
   alternative, low-cost solution.
   Methodology We conducted the experiment with students' (N=100) responses
   to videos and VR technologies used in a higher education setting. We
   also applied a quantitative research approach examined in light of media
   richness and affective experience theories.
   Contribution This study provides evidence of the integral role that VR
   technologies and 360 degrees video content play, because using low-cost
   VR headsets potentially decreases the initial affective experiences of
   360 degrees videos among students. Although VR headsets improve media
   richness, they might simultaneously weaken students' overall affective
   experiences if they experience usability challenges.
   Findings The results showed that using low-cost VR headsets decreased
   positive user experiences when they were watching 360 degrees videos.
   The 360 degrees video experience was noted to be better without low-cost
   VR headsets. Low-cost VR headsets with a smartphone and 360 degrees
   videos were found to be complicated to set up and use among first-time
   users. However, 360 degrees videos created a more positive affect than
   did 2D videos. We also found that the positive affect of videos enhanced
   the social sharing intention.
   Recommendations for Practitioners Educational institutes and teachers
   with limited financial budgets need to plan and manage courses that
   increases their need to adopt low-cost VR headsets. However, a poor
   initial user experience of low-cost VR technology usability might create
   negative student attitudes, which might hinder VR's adoption rate in
   higher education.
   Recommendations for Researchers This study provides a new understanding
   about students' affective experiences of 2D videos and 360 degrees
   videos with and without low-cost VR headsets. The results show that
   positive user experiences of 2D and 360 degrees videos enhance students'
   interest in sharing and collaboration in digital learning environments.
   Impact on Society The results help educators to predict possible
   usability challenges in selecting the proper rich media for different
   learning situations. Additionally, the results assist educators to
   design VR assisted courses that motivate students.
   Future Research The experimental comparison of different VR solutions
   and traditional learning technologies merits further examination.
   Additionally, more research is needed to determine the relationship of
   VR technologies, video content and learning methods, because
   technological features and content are tightly integrated in VR.},

Abstract = {The European Higher Education Area promotes the implementation of
   proposals for innovation and self-learning among university students to
   improve their learning process.
   The current work describes the experience and the impact on teaching and
   learning on first-year students of the subject ``Chemical Principles of
   Engineering{''}, in the laboratory practices of this subject. A large
   number of theses students is not adequately trained before starting
   laboratory practices, many of them did not study chemistry at high
   school nor worked in laboratories before
   Before going to the laboratory, the students watch a video which shows
   the how the practice must practice must be done. The videos were filmed
   by previous year's students and the best ones were chosen and they were
   available in a space in the virtual platform.
   The aim of this work was improving their preparation prior laboratory
   practices, enhanced their interest in experimental work and improved the
   students `self-learning skills of students
   We found the time used by the students to complete the experiments was
   reduced considerably, compared with those from previous years (and did
   not use the videos), the qualitative in the experimental results was
   improved also observed, perhaps because they felt less stressed as they
   began to discover and make use of the intricacies of the equipment
   during their experiments
   On the other hand, we analyze engineering students `perception of
   Chemistry practices by collecting their perceptions by using anonymous
   questionnaires.},

   help learners with various needs find desired information efficiently.
   Here, we propose an automatic visual transition detection method to
   partition lecture videos into self-contained segments, which is the
   foundation to structuralize video and support non-linear navigation. Our
   method can be done at scale and has been proved being able to achieve

Abstract = {Background Globally, digital skills are a crucial aspect of education
   that schools should develop systematically. Research on digital skills
   tends to be measured using self-reports, performance tests or
   interventions. There is less knowledge about student and teacher uptake
   of technology in school, making it important to investigate the actual
   use of technology and digital skills in authentic classroom settings.
   Objectives This study contributes unique baseline data concerning
   students' use of technology and digital skills across mandatory English
   courses in real classroom settings in secondary schools in Norway over
   time. Methods The study adapted a national framework for digital skills
   into an observation protocol. With it, this study analysed videos from
   60 naturally occurring English lessons in 13 English classes at seven
   lower secondary schools over two school years (grades 9 and 10),
   following 186 students (aged 13-15) and 10 teachers. Results and
   Conclusions Students used digital skills critical for education in half
   of the video-recorded English lessons, with more digital skill use at
   some schools over time. The main finding across classrooms and school
   years regards students' use of basic, not advanced, digital skills.
   Takeaways Although teachers provide opportunities for students to use
   digital skills in school, more advanced skills are needed. This work
   calls for continued use of video recordings to provide systematic
   comparisons of potential shifts in students' digital skills in real
   English secondary classroom settings over time.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 26},
Abstract = {Although the Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL) practice
   has a trend in its application, limited information exists in the
   literature on CSCL studies with Problem/Project-Based Learning in
   Computer Education. Therefore, this study reviewed 37 Social Science
   Citation Indexed (SSCI) articles on Problem/Project-Based CSCL practice
   in Computer Education from 2014 to 2023. The review focused on the
   research methods, educational technologies, interactions, student group
   formation, and research outcomes. The findings revealed that the most
   used research method was quantitative, followed by the mixed-method
   approach, and most participants were undergraduates, followed by junior
   high school students. Most studies used interactive technologies in
   implementing CSCL, followed by web-based tools, Learning Management
   Systems (LMS), social media, and video conferencing. Six types of
   interaction were found among instructor, learner, content, and
   interface. The most applied student group formation technique was group
   attributes selection with the random selection method, followed by
   students' self-selection and teachers' selection, while few studies used
   member attributes based on students' personal traits and students'
   knowledge/competence. Regarding research outcomes, the students'
   perceptions were the most observed dependent variable, followed by
   students' knowledge gain, students' group task performance, and
   students' social interaction. Surprisingly, students' critical thinking,
   computational thinking, and problem-solving skills were found to be
   relatively understudied. Further suggestions for future studies in
   implementing and evaluating CSCL practices for researchers, educators,
   and policymakers in Computer Education settings are provided.},

Title = {Understanding self-assessment as an informed process: residents' use of
   external information for self-assessment of performance in simulated
   resuscitations},

Abstract = {Self-directed learning requires self-assessment of learning needs and
   performance, a complex process that requires collecting and interpreting
   data from various sources. Learners' approaches to self-assessment
   likely vary depending on the learner and the context. The aim of this
   study was to gain insight into how learners process external information
   and apply their interpretation of this information to their
   self-assessment and learning during a structured educational activity.
   The study combined quantitative performance data with qualitative
   interview data. Pediatric residents led video-recorded simulated
   resuscitations and rated their crisis resource management skills on a
   validated 6-item instrument. Three independent observers rated the
   videos using the same instrument. During semi-structured interviews,
   each resident reviewed the video, rerated performance, discussed the
   self-assessment process, and interpreted feedback and observer scores.
   Transcripts were analyzed for themes. Sixteen residents participated.
   Residents' self-assessed scores ranged widely but usually fell within
   two points of the observers. They almost universally lowered their
   scores when self-assessing after the video review. Five major themes
   emerged from qualitative analysis of their interviews: (1) residents
   found self-assessment important and useful in certain contexts and
   conditions; (2) residents varied in their self-directed learning
   behaviors after the simulated resuscitation; (3) quantitative observer
   assessment had limited usefulness; (4) video review was difficult but
   useful; and (5) residents focused on their weaknesses and felt a need
   for constructive feedback to enhance learning. The residents in our
   study almost uniformly embraced the importance of self-assessment for
   all medical professionals. Even though video review had a negative
   impact on their self-assessment scores and was perceived as painful,
   residents saw this as the most useful aspect of the study exercises
   residents. They were less accepting of the quantitative assessment by
   observers. Residents explained their tendency to focus on weaknesses as
   a way to create an incentive for learning, demonstrating that
   self-assessment is closely linked to self-directed learning. How
   learners can use video review and external assessment most effectively
   to guide their self-directed learning deserves further study.},

Abstract = {This work covers the first stages of a process for designing and
   implementing an educational resource that aims to promote social and
   emotional competences in secondary students through independent video
   games. We start reviewing different educational uses of games based on
   the main learning theories. Then we highlight the strengths of
   independent games, focusing on the possibilities that they offer for
   promoting variables such as self-esteem, empathy, identification of
   emotions, responsible decision making, and creativity. After explaining
   the peculiarities of design-based research, we define the problem that
   guides this work (the lack of resources for teachers), we show the first
   version of our proposal based on a sociocultural theoretical framework,
   and we present strategies for gathering information from teachers to
   improve the quality of the educational resource. We conclude by showing
   some of the teachers' first reactions after a face-to-face workshop
   where we presented the resource and the ways that their vision would
   impact future versions.},

Abstract = {It is widely known that Information and Communication Technology is
   nowadays a key factor in the education field, especially after the boost
   received with the publication of ICT competency standards for teachers
   (Unesco 2008). Within this framework, multimedia materials stand out as
   extremely valuable resources for teaching, especially for foreign
   language teaching.
   It is often said that an image is worth a thousand words and, as a
   matter of fact, images have proved to be especially effective when it
   comes to teaching. It seems clear that there is a link between the use
   of video as an instructional tool and improved learning in different
   subjects.
   This paper focuses on the use of video to teach ESL to college students
   who aim to become teachers. In such a scenario, we can work with
   different types of video content, both in the classroom and in a virtual
   environment, to achieve diverse objectives. Firstly, the display of
   videos produced for educational purposes allows teachers to work
   specific grammar, vocabulary and pronunciation issues. Secondly, real
   English videos (films, news, series, documentaries...), when correctly
   used, offer several advantages: they boost students' motivation, they
   offer real usage language, and they add a cultural background which is
   essential for mastering a foreign language. Thirdly, we have the option
   of using videos as a creative tool proposing students the possibility of
   recording and editing their own works. On the one hand, our students can
   record themselves in order to carry out self assessment of their
   productions; on the other hand, they can also use one of the several
   software applications which allow them to download and edit video so
   that they can create their own products and share it with their peers,
   encouraging collaborative work.
   This paper will describe and analyse the different possibilities of
   using videos as a tool for promoting learning and self learning in ESL
   students in the Teaching Studies degree.},

Abstract = {Distance learning becomes the new trend of development. When learners
   conduct distance learning, the features and the free status of distance
   learning make it easy for students to become distracted or unfocused in
   their learning. Therefore, design a material with cues based on
   ``Central Cue{''} and ``Peripheral Cue{''} from ``Attentional Cuing
   Paradigm{''} to explore two cues that represent ``endogenous{''} and
   ``exogenous{''} attentional cueing by using multimedia video learning,
   to check whether it can effectively enhance the focus on the target area
   of interest (AOI) and the impact of the learning achievements and
   varieties. Detect learners' eye movements and patterns by an eye tracker
   to analyze the relationship between learners' watching patterns and
   learning achievements. In addition, we use two-tier testing combined
   with self-explanation prompts for design, including the menu-based
   self-explanation strategy on the first level and the open-ended
   self-explanation strategy on the second level. Explore whether the
   two-tier self-explanation strategy will have better self-explanation
   learning achievements than the single-tier self-explanation strategy or
   not. The results show that learners using the central cue representing
   endogenous attentional cueing can effectively focus on the target AOI.
   The two-tier self-explanation strategy can help learners improve their
   learning achievement, learning motivation, and reflection.},

Abstract = {Videos are an integral part of online courses. In this study, customized
   YouTube videos were explored as teaching and learning materials in place
   of face-to-face discussion sessions in General Chemistry courses. The
   videos were created using a budget-friendly and interactive app on an
   iPad. The customized YouTube videos were available to students on; a
   YouTube channel dedicated to the course. Use of videos enabled students
   to pause and rewatch the videos as required. Pedagogical benefits of
   using the videos included opportunities for 24/7 and self-paced
   learning. Beyond the classroom learning was documented using the
   analytics option through YouTube (method 1) and Learning Management
   System (method 2). Data mining shows the following: (a) learning
   throughout the semester, (b) around-the-clock learning activity right
   before the final exam, (c) comparable average fmal exam performance
   observed during semesters with face-to-face discussions versus
   customized YouTube videos, and (d) students continuing to watch these
   videos beyond the course while reviewing content for competitive exams

Abstract = {The acrosport is an ideal content to work in physical education classes
   due to its cooperative and integrating characteristics and the multiple
   benefits it can bring to the students. The aim of this research is to
   analyze the perception of 81 students of High School after carrying out
   an acrosport unit using the technologies and involving the students in
   the evaluation process. For this, a qualitative methodology with
   descriptive character was used. The instrument for the collection data
   was the semi-structured interview where questions were addressed about
   the benefits and difficulties encountered in the development of the
   unit, as well as about the usefulness perceived by adolescents of the
   use of video during the development of the unit and self-evaluation. The
   qualitative data were coded according to the narrative content of the
   students and analysed with the AQUAD 7 programme. The results show that
   the students perceive benefits in terms of enjoyment and companionship
   in this practice. Regarding the difficulties encountered, the lack of
   time and the specific requirements for the development of this modality
   are the most outstanding aspects. Furthermore, the student's value
   positively the use of video in the acrosport classes and the
   self-evaluation supported by rubrics. In this way, the practice of
   acrosport contributes numerous affective-social benefits, concluding in
   addition, that the use of the video and the inclusion of the students in
   the evaluation allow them to be participants of their teaching-learning
   process, being able to contribute to the formation of more critical and

Abstract = {How to learn discriminative video representation from unlabeled videos
   is challenging but crucial for video analysis. The latest attempts seek
   to learn a representation model by predicting the appearance contents in
   the masked regions. However, simply masking and recovering appearance
   contents may not be sufficient to model temporal clues as the appearance
   contents can be easily reconstructed from a single frame. To overcome
   this limitation, we present Masked Motion Encoding (MME), a new
   pre-training paradigm that reconstructs both appearance and motion
   information to explore temporal clues. In MME, we focus on addressing
   two critical challenges to improve the representation performance: 1)
   how to well represent the possible long-term motion across multiple
   frames; and 2) how to obtain fine-grained temporal clues from sparsely
   sampled videos. Motivated by the fact that human is able to recognize an
   action by tracking objects' position changes and shape changes, we
   propose to reconstruct a motion trajectory that represents these two
   kinds of change in the masked regions. Besides, given the sparse video
   input, we enforce the model to reconstruct dense motion trajectories in
   both spatial and temporal dimensions. Pre-trained with our MME paradigm,
   the model is able to anticipate long-term and fine-grained motion
   details. Code is available at https://github.com/XinyuSun/MME.},

Abstract = {This paper foregrounds teacher practitioners' implementation experiences
   and reflections of a web-based Collaborative Video Annotation and
   Learning Analytics (CoVAA) intervention aimed at enhancing video-based
   teaching and learning in schools, with a view to foster secondary
   students' conceptual understanding, social knowledge construction, and
   self-regulated learning dispositions. We first briefly outline the key
   learning principles that underpin the design of CoVAA, namely social
   dialogic learning, assessment for learning, and computer-supported
   collaborative learning. Next, we explain its two key learning
   affordances: (i) timepoint-based collaborative video annotation
   supplemented by a live interactive chatboard, and (ii) rapid digital
   formative feedback in the form of teacher and learner dashboards. We
   then illustrate how teachers implement these in their classrooms.
   Teachers' sense-making of the learning and teaching gains, challenges
   and pathways forward for leveraging on these contemporary digital social
   learning affordances to enhance video-based classroom practices are
   presented and discussed.},

Journal = {SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY},
Year = {2011},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Pages = {593-611},
Abstract = {This paper explores the role of digital media and creativity in the
   processes of learning that occur in groups of urban skateboarders. In
   particular, it examines how the production and consumption of amateur
   videos contribute to both skaters' mastery of the techniques of the
   sport and their integration into the culture of the sport. The data come
   from an ethnographic study of skateboarders in Hong Kong, which included
   in-depth interviews, participant observation and the collection of texts
   and artifacts like magazines, blog entries and amateur skating videos.
   Skateboarders use video in a number of ways that significantly impact
   their learning and integration into their communities. They use it to
   analyze tricks and techniques, to document the stages of their learning
   and socialization into the group, to set community standards, to build a
   sense of belonging with their `crews' and to imagine `idealized futures'
   for themselves and their communities. Understanding the value and
   function of such `semiotic mediation' in learning and socialization into
   sport cultures, I suggest, can contribute to helping physical educators
   design tasks that integrate training in physical skills with
   opportunities for students to make meaning around their experiences of
   sport and physical education.},

Abstract = {YouTube's contribution to EFL learning has made it an enticing learning
   media for students in this millennial era. YouTube created engaging
   atmosphere for learning English. Because of this, this study was carried
   out with two objectives in mind The first objective was to reveal how
   factors in higher education affected the YouTube video project. The
   second objective was to provide evidence showing students'
   self-improvement in EFL learning via the YouTube video project. The data
   collected in this study was obtained from seventy-nine non-English
   speaking students in higher education. Data was collected via
   reflections written by the participating students. The content of these
   reflections was then synthesized and subsequently analysed. The analysis
   indicated that six factors influenced the reflection process of YouTube
   video project. These were as follows: behaviour, competencies, beliefs,
   environment, identity and mission. Additionally, the study indicated
   improvements in other areas such as the development of team work skills,
   ability to manage stress, technological ability and creativity.
   Especially in delivering information and enriching knowledge either the
   knowledge that was related to English learning or other types of
   knowledge in broader scope. Surprisingly, the study indicated that
   students' English language skills were not significantly increased
   compared to the result of the self-quality improvements.},

Title = {Efficacy of Annotated Video-Based Learning Environment for Drawing
   Students' Attention to Construction Practice Concepts},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING AND MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {150},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {To enhance students' learning of construction practice, instructors use
   videos as multimedia pedagogical tools to bring practical experience
   into the classroom. However, cognitive load levels, individual
   differences, and multimedia design principles are important
   considerations in the effective use of videos for instruction.
   Therefore, this study investigates the effectiveness of an artificial
   intelligence (AI)-annotated video in guiding students' attention to
   important construction practice concepts. Students were exposed to both
   annotated and unannotated videos illustrating construction safety
   practices. Eye tracking metrics and self-reported cognitive load were
   collected as students interacted with both learning environments. The
   effectiveness of the videos in drawing students' attention were
   compared. The AI-annotated video was considered effective and the
   variations across individual differences were reported. No significant
   difference was observed in the cognitive loads of both learning
   environments. This study provides an understanding of the extent to
   which learners of different demographic characteristics allocate
   attention to signaled practice concepts. This study also illustrates the
   impact of the signaled concepts on learners' cognitive loads. This study
   contributes to existing theories by elucidating how practice knowledge
   could be adapted to meet construction engineering students' learning
   needs.},

   https://doi.org/10.1080/00461520.2019.1625776), there also has been an
   increasing concern that the existing understanding of SEL is not based

   on promoting an equity-based approach for Social and Emotion\& Learning
   (SEL) in physical education teacher education (PETE) from an
   international perspective. Using an international comparative case study
   design (Penn, R. (2019). International comparative case studies:
   Multiple methods in action. Sage.), 18 teacher educators were recruited
   from 10 different countries (Australia; Brazil; Cyprus; China; Finland;
   Germany; Ireland; New Zealand; South Korea; The United States).
   Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted using a
   video-conferencing system to collect data on the participants'
   perspectives on promoting equity-based SEL in PETE. Using a systematic
   process of inductive data analysis by Miles et al. (Miles, M. B.,
   Huberman, A. M., \& Saldana, J. (2014). Qualitative data analysis: A
   methods sourcebook. Sage.), four findings were generated: (a) Respecting
   differences with culturally responsive pedagogy, (b) Embedding diversity
   across different phases, (c) Critical introspection on self and others,
   and (d) Having intentional and difficult conversations. Based on the
   findings, more research needs to be conducted in the future to
   investigate how PE teachers incorporate equity elements into their SEL
   practices in real-time school settings.},

   explanation on learning from video lectures},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Learning from video lectures is becoming a prevalent learning activity
   in formal and informal settings. However, relatively little research has
   been carried out on the interactions of learning strategies and social
   environment in learning from video lectures. The present study addresses
   this gap by examining whether learner-generated explanations and
   co-learner presence with or without nonverbal praise independently and
   interactively affected learning from a self-paced video lecture about
   infectious diseases. University students were randomized into viewing
   either the video with instructor-generated explanations or the same
   video but generating explanations themselves. Outcomes were assessed by
   the quality of explanations, learning performance, mental effort,
   attention allocation, and behavioral patterns. Between-group comparisons
   showed that, in the absence of a peer co-learner, learning performance
   was similar in both the instructor-generated and learner-generated
   explanation groups. However, in the presence of a peer,
   learner-generated explanation facilitated learning performance.
   Furthermore, learner-generated explanation in the presence of a
   co-learner also reduced learners' mental effort and primed more
   behaviors related to self-regulation and monitoring. The results lead to
   the following strong recommendation for educational practice when using
   video lectures: if students learn by generating their own explanations
   in the presence of a co-learner, they will show better learning
   performance even though the learning is not necessarily more demanding,
   and will engage in more behaviors related to explanation adjustment and
   self-regulation.},

Abstract = {Increasing migration leads the education landscape to face the challenge
   of integrating children into the school system, accounting for inherent
   disadvantages. On average, as nearly half of them face socio-economic
   disadvantages, a persistent performance disparity was observed compared
   to domestic students. Remarkably, even after mitigating the influence of
   socioeconomic status, immigrant students' scores remained inferior. From
   March to May 2023, the AI Education (AIEDN) research project
   investigated how an AI-based learning assistant can compensate for
   existing impediments by enabling a better understanding through
   video-based learning. For this study, 275 students were selected from
   two secondary schools (N=137) and two grammar schools (N=138) in
   Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany. The experiment tested the extent to which
   learners solve more tasks, build broader (transfer) knowledge, and
   retain it. Students were repeatedly tested on mathematical problems,
   where the control group did not have access to the AI assistant. In
   contrast, the other group used the AI assistant to solve the problems.
   The students' performances from both school groups were statistically
   tested using t-tests. Within the test group of grammar schools, a
   significant change in the results between the two test days existed
   (T(41)=-2,28; p<.01) when the AI tool was used. In contrast, the control
   group showed no significant change T(37)=-.42; p>.05; d=.07) in
   performance. However, the results were insignificant for the secondary
   school students, as the given tasks and video content were considered
   too demanding. Further research is needed to determine AIEDN's
   performance for other target groups.},

Abstract = {Designed-based research principles guided the study of 51
   secondary-science teachers in the second year of a 3-year professional
   development project. The project entailed the creation of
   student-centered, inquiry-based, science, video games. A professional
   development model appropriate for infusing innovative technologies into
   standards-based curricula was employed to determine how science
   teacher's attitudes and efficacy where impacted while designing
   science-based video games. The study's mixed-method design ascertained
   teacher efficacy on five factors (General computer use, Science
   Learning, Inquiry Teaching and Learning, Synchronous chat/text, and
   Playing Video Games) related to technology and gaming using a web-based
   survey). Qualitative data in the form of online blog posts was gathered
   during the project to assist in the triangulation and assessment of
   teacher efficacy. Data analyses consisted of an Analysis of Variance and
   serial coding of teacher reflective responses. Results indicated
   participants who used computers daily have higher efficacy while using
   inquiry-based teaching methods and science teaching and learning.
   Additional emergent findings revealed possible motivating factors for
   efficacy. This professional development project was focused on inquiry
   as a pedagogical strategy, standard-based science learning as means to
   develop content knowledge, and creating video games as technological
   knowledge. The project was consistent with the Technological Pedagogical
   Content Knowledge (TPCK) framework where overlapping circles of the
   three components indicates development of an integrated understanding of
   the suggested relationships. Findings provide suggestions for
   development of standards-based science education software, its
   integration into the curriculum and, strategies for implementing
   technology into teaching practices.},

Abstract = {This study investigated help-seeking activities in a computer-based
   environment teaching argumentative skills by videos of argumentative
   dialogues of teachers who discussed controversy issues in the context of
   a workshop. Learners, all of them students of educational sciences,
   solved learning tasks on the presented argumentative dialogues and
   reflected on their response certitude. Forty-three students voluntary
   took part in the study. Two experimental groups varied according to the
   type of task they solved. Group 1 got adjunct questions, so-called
   self-explanation prompts that elicited elaboration of the video content.
   Group 2 answered multiple-choice tasks that assessed the same knowledge.
   After each task, participants of both groups (a) had to judge the
   certainty of their response being correct (i.e., the marking of the
   multiple-choice task or the written self-explanations) and (b) were
   offered to use the help function on demand. Results revealed the
   relevance of learners' response certitude with respect to their help
   use. Low response certitude about the correctness of a task solution led
   to higher help use which was positively related to learning outcome.
   However, learners' response certitude was unrelated to the actual
   correctness of their task solution. Type of task had no influence on
   response certitude, help use or learning outcome.},

Abstract = {Video modeling is an educative methodology which can be applied in
   different contexts (home, school, rehabilitation services, community) to
   gain significative and functional learnings regarding the areas of
   communication, daily care skills and socialization. Video modeling is a
   technique to support the development of competencies and skills of
   children with autism. The aim of this paper is about an intervention
   based on video modeling technique, investigating how a child with autism
   spectrum disorder can teaching self-care skill through the use of a
   tablet pc. The self-care procedure taken into consideration is about
   brushing teeth. The widespread use of tablet PCs today requires
   investigating whether the technique of video modeling can be used in
   natural conditions, where the child with autism can observe the right
   learning procedure in the appropriate context. We assume that video
   modeling using a tablet pc can foster the acquiring of self-care skill,
   in an effective way and in short times. For our study we use a single
   case study with A-B-A research design. The study has been conducted in
   the research centre of Neapolisanit in Ottaviano (Italy) for 12
   observations sessions. The procedure of brushing the teeth has been into
   many small steps (17) and 4 videos to be played on the tablet pc and
   useful for teaching to the child the correct procedure to clean his
   teeth has been recorded by one educational therapist; the task-analysis
   is literally the analysis of the task through which a procedure or an
   activity are deconstructed in several sections which facilitate the
   task. The child involved in our study attends four hours of
   rehabilitation treatments a week, and, before this experimentation, he
   was never involved in video modeling treatment. The research data
   collected during experiment give a constant number of performed
   behaviours in the first three baseline sessions (without tablet pc) with
   11 correct behaviour of 17 steps of the task analysis. In the fourth
   baseline the subject performs 12 correct behaviours of 17 steps. More
   than half of the behaviors have already been acquired by child without
   tablet pc. By the introduction of the video modeling we observe a
   gradual improvement: at the first, the second, the third and the fourth
   intervention sessions (with tablet pc with videos) we have noticed
   respectively 13, 15, 16 and yet 16 correct behaviors on 17. Up to the
   peak of 17 behaviors on 17 in the fifth session of intervention, and
   then return to 16 correct behavior in the sixth session. In the
   inversion baseline, removing the independent variable of the video
   (tablet pc), the child still keeps high levels of performance,
   demonstrating that he has learnt behaviors that he hadn't acquired yet
   in the first baseline and that he wouldn't have acquired without the
   imitative stimulus of the video, which allowed him to learn new gestures
   to perform, which are effective to a good and complete oral hygiene. We
   can conclude that the video modeling using tablet pc in a natural
   environment has been an effective and efficient teaching modality for
   the children to learn a self-care skill.},

Title = {Fostering pre-service teachers' self-regulated learning through self-
   and peer assessment of wiki projects},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},

Abstract = {This study investigates whether self-regulated learning of pre-service
   early-childhood teachers is a viable pedagogy to improve the quality of
   their wild-based projects. A total of 76 early-childhood pre-service
   teachers in their first year of study at a teacher training institute in
   Hong Kong participated in this study. The tasks involved were based on
   seven principles for supporting and developing self-regulated learning.
   The pre-service teachers formed groups to apply the skills and knowledge
   that were taught by the author by creating educational wild sites for
   young children to learn about a topic of their choice. This was then
   followed by preliminary-self-assessment, class presentations of the wild
   projects, peer assessment, revision of the projects and
   final-self-assessment. Indeed, the pre-service teachers' involvement in
   assessing wild projects perfectly aligns with the collaborative spirit
   of authoring wiki projects.
   Quantitative data were collected using a questionnaire and the self- and
   peer assessment reports, whilst qualitative data were collected from a
   focus group held with six of the students. It is noteworthy that the
   students tended to be more demanding of themselves than of their
   classmates, as shown by a significant difference between
   preliminary-self assessment and peer assessment in the scores for three
   out of four criteria (p value = 0.011). The mean for
   preliminary-self-made video was rated the lowest by
   preliminary-self-assessment but it was rated the highest by peers. Since
   the p-value is 0.024, which is less than 0.05, this difference is
   significant. The focus-group participants thought their peers and the
   teacher provided helpful feedback, but did not find the self assessment
   particularly useful. Although the data from the questionnaires and focus
   groups show that the pre-service teachers considered formative
   assessment approaches helpful, and all the mean final-self-assessment
   scores improved, the differences between preliminary-self-assessment and
   final-self-assessment were not significant. The research findings show
   that the students were active wild creators and assessors and yet they
   did not have enough confidence in themselves. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All

   perspective},
Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 31},
Abstract = {The benefits of using social annotations to promote collaborative
   learning experiences have been investigated in the context of digital
   reading and listening, while its implications in multimedia learning
   contexts remain unclear. To investigate the influence of social
   annotations on multimedia language learning, we invited 16 African
   participants who were learning Chinese as a second language through a
   MOOC platform in China. They were given full autonomy to study and to
   shift instructional videos between three modes: no visual aids,
   linguistic captions, and social annotations. Guided by
   self-determination theory, the qualitative data were collected through
   one-to-one interviews, while quantitative data, such as the duration of
   watching and the number of questions raised by participants, were
   obtained from observations. Statistical analysis suggests that MOOC
   learners demonstrated a higher level of engagement and motivation in the
   social annotation mode than in the other two modes. These statistical
   findings can be explained from the following three perspectives: content
   and emotion-related social annotations by other L1 viewers can assist in
   (1) checking their comprehension of the video by comparing their
   understanding with others; (2) adjusting learning goals at both the
   linguistic and content level and therefore using self-regulated learning
   strategies to a greater extent, especially in actively seeking
   assistance and other learning resources, and (3) relating the video
   content to the teaching curriculum/personal experience/learning goals,
   therefore creating a sense of belonging to a larger language learner
   community as language learners, interpreters and contributors to the
   video social annotations.},

Abstract = {Background:Since 2019, the United States (US) has witnessed an
   unprecedented increase in drug overdose and alcohol-related deaths.
   Despite this rise in morbidity and mortality, treatment rates for
   substance use disorder remain inadequate. Insufficient training in
   addiction along with a dearth of addiction providers are key barriers to
   addressing the current addiction epidemic. Addiction-related clinical
   experiences can improve trainee knowledge, yet they remain dependent on
   practice sites and residency training environments. Asynchronous
   learning, in the form of video-based modules, may serve as a complement
   to formal, scheduled lectures and clinical experiences.ObjectivesTo
   evaluate the educational impact of a video-based addiction curriculum in
   2 residency programs at a large safety net academic medical center with
   a high volume of patients with substance use disorders.MethodsFamily
   Medicine (FM) and Internal Medicine (IM) residency interns (PGY1s) (n =
   60) had access to 28 minutes of video content related to opioid use
   disorder (OUD) and alcohol use disorder (AUD) during the first 2 months
   of their residency training. Interns were asked to complete voluntary
   and anonymized pre- and post-surveys in Qualtrics that included
   knowledge and confidence-based questions about the management of OUD and
   AUD, in addition to questions about prior exposure to and future
   interests in addiction training and practice. Data were analyzed with
   non-parametric sign tests.ResultsTwenty-eight interns completed both OUD
   pre- and post-surveys, and 24 interns completed all AUD survey
   questions. There was a statistically significant increase in the number
   of interns who reported increased knowledge of and confidence around
   diagnosis, management, and ability to provide evidence-based treatment
   recommendations for both OUD and AUD.ConclusionsBrief addiction focused
   video-modules can improve confidence and knowledge in managing OUD and
   AUD among medical trainees.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the flipped classroom has become prevalent in many
   educational settings. Flipped classroom adopts a pedagogical model in
   which short video lectures are viewed by students at home before class
   so that the teacher can lead students to participate in activities,
   problem-solving, and discussions. Yet the design or use of technology
   that employs planned instructional strategies with sustainable support
   of self-regulation is scant. We propose a technology-enhanced flipped
   language learning system (Flip2Learn) that provides facilitation and
   guidance for learning performance and self-regulation. A
   quasi-experimental study was carried out to examine whether Flip2Learn
   could enhance college students' self-regulatory skills and later
   contribute to the learning performance in the flipped classrooms. The
   results showed that Flip2Learn not only better prepared students for
   flipped classrooms but also better promoted learning performance
   compared to the conventional flipped classrooms. The results of this
   research advanced our understanding of the dynamics of flipped
   classrooms and represented a revolutionary new approach to the
   technology-enhanced learning for flipped classrooms.},

Abstract = {Informed by cognitive theories of learning, this work examined how
   students' self-reported study patterns (spacing vs. cramming)
   corresponded to their engagement with the Learning Management System
   (LMS) across two years in a large biology course. We specifically
   focused on how students accessed non-mandatory resources (lecture
   videos, lecture slides) and considered whether this pattern differed by
   underrepresented minority (URM) status. Overall, students who
   self-reported utilizing spacing strategies throughout the course had
   higher grades than students who reported cramming throughout the course.
   When examining LMS engagement, only a small percentage of students
   accessed the lecture videos and lecture slides. Applying a negative
   binomial regression model to daily counts of click activities, we also
   found that students who utilized spacing strategies accessed LMS
   resources more often but not earlier before major deadlines. Moreover,
   this finding was not different for underrepresented students. Our
   results provide some initial evidence showing how spacing behaviors
   correspond to accessing learning resources. However, given the lack of
   general engagement with LMS resources, our results underscore the value
   of encouraging students to utilize these resources when studying course
   material.},

Abstract = {Many educational workers are considering the use of technology-based
   distance learning system to meet those needs. By using the following
   five computer technologies delivery tools: 1) ISDN-based
   videoconferencing, 2) the compressed video/audio recording, 3) the
   Internet, 4) the World-Wide Web, and 5) the electronic mail, a
   multimedia distance education system will be established between
   countries throughout the world. All of the constructional phases of a
   combined distance learning system are highly interactive; each has an
   impact on the others. Likewise, information of target students feedback
   obtained from an evaluation phase will have a direct influence on how
   future iterations of the distance learning media are designed and
   carried out.
   Based on an existing experimental combined computer-technology distance
   learning system between the College of Pharmacy of NSU, Florida and the
   National Defense Medical College, Taiwan, the goal of the research is
   develop a set of quantitative metric to evaluate the distance learning
   system. A fifty-five-item questionnaire will be filled out by all target
   students. The contribution of this evaluation is not only to elicit
   reactions from target students for systems satisfaction levels and
   educational delivery problems, but to give the researcher critical
   strengths or weaknesses on the useful and appropriate guidelines for
   future distance learning system reforming.},

Abstract = {Diabetes is a global public health problem. Maintaining optimal glycemic
   control is critical for minimizing associated long-term complications
   and achieving better quality of life. Effective diabetes self-management
   education is one key component to enhance diabetes clients'
   self-management capabilities. The research team established a ``Caring
   for Yourself-Managing Your Diabetes{''} Web site, which contained 35
   video clips about diabetes management. The aim of this study was to
   evaluate user satisfaction with the Web-based diabetes self-management
   education program. A convenience sample of 100 diabetes clients (mean
   age, 61.5 {[}SD, 10.7] years) was invited to view one of the video clips
   via a laptop computer. A modified version of the Computer-Aided Learning
   Evaluation Questionnaire and the End-User Computing Satisfaction
   Questionnaire was used to evaluate participants' satisfaction with the
   program. The results indicate that participants were satisfied with the
   format, content, and accuracy of the Web-based diabetes education
   program. Some participants suggested adding different types of exercises
   that are specific to the needs of client groups and more explanation of
   diabetes medications. The results of this study support the use of
   computer-assisted learning as a promising method for delivering diabetes
   self-management education, which is satisfactory to diabetes clients.},

Title = {E-Learning in Teaching Emergency Disaster Response Among Undergraduate
   Medical Students in Malaysia},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {9},
Month = {APR 29},
Abstract = {Introduction: Teaching disaster response medicine (DRM) to medical
   students requires considerable resources. We evaluate the effectiveness
   of e-learning in teaching emergency disaster response (ELITE-DR), a
   novel initiative, in educating medical students of the cognitive aspect
   of DRM.
   Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study among pre-clinical year
   medical students was carried out to determine their knowledge on DRM and
   perception regarding the ELITE-DR initiative using a validated online
   questionnaire. A three-part self-learning video covering the principles
   and medical management of DRM were distributed before answering the
   questionnaire served as the training.
   Results: A total of 168 students participated in the study. Their
   overall knowledge showed a significant increase in between
   pre-and-post-interventions. Recall and simple decision-making knowledge
   aspects were better than complex decision-making knowledge. It appeared
   that participants assimilate knowledge better from visual rather than
   audio stimuli. Participants with high perception-scores demonstrated
   better knowledge-scores. However, e-learning was not preferred as a
   substitute for face-to-face (F2F) teaching.
   Conclusion: ELITE-DR shows promise in teaching DRM. Simple recall and
   comprehension levels of knowledge were well-served through this
   technique. However, for more complex decision-making knowledge, a
   different approach might be required. ELITE-DR offers flexibility,
   accessibility, and personalized learning. The content presentation is
   improved by using several different visual stimuli. This approach is
   useful for cognitive aspect learning, but it should not replace standard
   F2F teaching.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Video coaching has been found to be an effective teaching
   method because it incorporates many of the established principles of
   successful adult learning. The goal of our study was to assess the
   feasibility and effectiveness of using a point-of-view video camera
   (Google Glass) to improve the surgical skills education of orthopaedic
   surgery residents.
   METHODS: Forty-two residents from 4 institutions participated in a
   partially blinded randomized control trial performing an intra-articular
   distal tibial fracture reduction task while wearing Google Glass to
   record the performance. Participants underwent a structured coaching
   session with 20 participants (intervention group) using the recorded
   video to augment this session, and 22 participants (control group)
   receiving verbal coaching alone. The task was repeated again immediately
   after the coaching session. Performance was scored using an Objective
   Structured Assessment of Technical Skills checklist, Global Rating
   Scale, fluoroscopic usage, and reduction quality. A semistructured
   interview was then performed to assess experience of participants.
   RESULTS: There was no significant difference (p > 0.05) seen in score
   improvement in the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
   checklist, Global Rating Scale, fluoroscopic usage, or reduction quality
   between the control and intervention groups. Thematic analysis of
   interview showed majority of participants found video coaching increased
   effectiveness in understanding of goals, developing techniques and
   strategies, and process of self-reflection. Their involvement was seen
   overall as a positive experience, with participants wanting to see more
   inclusion of video coaching within surgical education.
   CONCLUSIONS: No difference in performance improvement between the 2
   groups was seen, but majority of participants found the video coaching
   sessions valuable and could have potential beneficial role in education.

Abstract = {A trend in anatomical education is the development of alternative
   pedagogical approaches to replace or complement experiences in a cadaver
   laboratory; however, empirical evidence on their effectiveness is often
   not reported. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of Anatomy
   Glove Learning System (AGLS), which enables students to learn the
   relationship between hand structure and function by drawing the
   structures onto a worn glove with imprinted bones. Massage therapy
   students (n = 73) were allocated into two groups and drew muscles onto
   either: (1) the glove using AGLS instructional videos (3D group); or (2)
   paper with palmar/dorsal views of hand bones during an instructor-guided
   activity (2D group). A self-confidence measure and knowledge test were
   completed before, immediately after, and one-week following the learning
   conditions. Self-confidence of hand anatomy in the 3D group gradually
   increased (3.2/10, 4.7/10, and 4.8/10), whereas self-confidence in the
   2D group began to decline one-week later (3.2/10, 4.4/10, and 3.9/10).
   Knowledge of hand anatomy improved in both groups immediately after
   learning, (P < 0.001). Students' perceptions of AGLS were also assessed
   using a 10-pt Likert scale evaluation questionnaire (10 = high).
   Students perceived the AGLS videos (mean = 8.3 +/- 2.0) and glove (mean
   = 8.1 +/- 1.8) to be helpful in improving their understanding of hand
   anatomy and the majority of students preferred AGLS as a learning tool
   (mean = 8.6 +/- 2.2). This study provides evidence demonstrating that
   AGLS and the traditional 2D learning approach are equally effective in
   promoting students' self-confidence and knowledge of hand anatomy. Anat

Abstract = {Objective: To identify, catalog, and critically evaluate Web-based
   resources for critical care education.
   Data Sources: A multilevel search strategy was utilized. Literature
   searches were conducted (from 1996 to September 30, 2010) using
   OVID-MEDLINE, PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied
   Health Literature with the terms ``Web-based learning,{''}
   ``computer-assisted instruction,{''} ``e-learning,{''} ``critical
   care,{''} ``tutorials,{''} ``continuing education,{''} ``virtual
   learning,{''} and ``Web-based education.{''} The Web sites of relevant
   critical care organizations (American College of Chest Physicians,
   American Society of Anesthesiologists, American Thoracic Society,
   European Society of Intensive Care Medicine, Society of Critical Care
   Medicine, World Federation of Societies of Intensive and Critical Care
   Medicine, American Association of Critical Care Nurses, and World
   Federation of Critical Care Nurses) were reviewed for the availability
   of e-learning resources. Finally, Internet searches and e-mail queries
   to critical care medicine fellowship program directors and members of
   national and international acute/critical care list-serves were
   conducted to 1) identify the use of and 2) review and critique Web-based
   resources for critical care education.
   Data Extraction and Data Synthesis: To ensure credibility of Web site
   information, Web sites were reviewed by three independent reviewers on
   the basis of the criteria of authority, objectivity, authenticity,
   accuracy, timeliness, relevance, and efficiency in conjunction with
   suggested formats for evaluating Web sites in the medical literature.
   Measurements and Main Results: Literature searches using OVID-MEDLINE,
   PubMed, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature
   resulted in >250 citations. Those pertinent to critical care provide
   examples of the integration of e-learning techniques, the development of
   specific resources, reports of the use of types of e-learning, including
   interactive tutorials, case studies, and simulation, and reports of
   student or learner satisfaction, among other general reviews of the
   benefits of utilizing e-learning. Review of the Web sites of relevant
   critical care organizations revealed the existence of a number of
   e-learning resources, including online critical care courses, tutorials,
   podcasts, webcasts, slide sets, and continuing medical education
   resources, some requiring membership or a fee to access. Respondents to
   listserve queries (>100) and critical care medicine fellowship director
   and advanced practice nursing educator e-mail queries (>50) identified
   the use of a number of tutorials, self-directed learning modules, and
   video-enhanced programs for critical care education and practice.
   Conclusions: In all, >135 Web-based education resources exist, including
   video Web resources for critical care education in a variety of
   e-learning formats, such as tutorials, self-directed learning modules,
   interactive case studies, webcasts, podcasts, and video-enhanced
   programs. As identified by critical care educators and practitioners,
   e-learning is actively being integrated into critical care medicine and
   nursing training programs for continuing medical education and
   competency training purposes. Knowledge of available Web-based
   educational resources may enhance critical care practitioners' ongoing
   learning and clinical competence, although this has not been objectively
   measured to date. (Crit Care Med 2011; 39: 541-553)},

Journal = {EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {37},

Pages = {1067-1081},
Abstract = {Video interaction guidance (VIG) is an increasingly recognised
   evidence-based intervention. VIG was used to enhance pupil responses
   during a group work programme. Fifteen primary-aged classes across a
   range of socio-economic status received regular group work over a year.
   A mixed methods repeated measures design involved nine experimental
   classes receiving intervention of three cycles of VIG. Six control
   classes did not receive the VIG intervention. Pre-to-post-test measures
   included: pupils' self-esteem in relation to learning, using the Myself
   as a Learner Scale; a peer assessment schedule based upon
   Fredericksonand Cameron's Social Inclusion Survey; and a researcher
   devised pupil questionnaire. Pupils' communicative behaviours were
   analysed for a random sample of 12 video clips. Results showed that
   reinforcement of desirable group work behaviours using VIG enhanced
   pupils' self-esteem. The VIG intervention significantly enhanced the
   experimental group. There was greatest impact on increasing the
   self-esteem of younger children. Experimental pupils' retrospective
   ratings of group work significantly increased, again youngest pupils
   showed greatest improvement. Film observations showed a trend towards an
   increase in pupils' open questions replacing closed questions. There was
   a significant positiveincrease in peer assessment of communicative
   behaviours across the whole sample, irrespective of the VIG
   intervention. Implications for practice and future research are
   discussed.},

Title = {The Effects of Video Instruction on Neuroscience Intensive Care Unit
   Nursing Skills in Case Presentations and Neurological Examinations},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSCIENCE NURSING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {53},
Number = {3},
Pages = {129-133},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: The emergence of neuroscience intensive care units (NSICUs)
   for the past decades has led to growing interest in targeted training
   for NSICU nurses. We sought to evaluate the use of video instruction on
   NSICU nurses' skills in case presentations and neurological
   examinations, which has timely advantages as an asynchronous and
   distanced learning modality. METHODS: We enrolled NSICU and surgical
   intensive care unit nurses who took shifts in the NSICU at our
   institution. Participants were observed by a neurocritical care
   attending physician presenting the clinical details of an admitted
   patient and conducting a neurological examination, with both parties
   completing a 10-item evaluation on NSICU nursing presentation and
   examination skills. Participants randomized to an intervention group
   were given access to an instructional video on NSICU nursing skills. A
   median of 21 days later, participants were observed by a physician
   blinded to study randomization, with both parties recompleting the
   evaluation. Differences between day 1 and day 21 scores were analyzed
   using paired sample t tests. RESULTS: Fifteen NSICU and 55 surgical
   intensive care unit nurses were enrolled. Surgical intensive care unit
   nurses in both the intervention and control groups had statistically
   significant improvement between day 1 and day 21 physician-rated scores,
   with a greater increase in the intervention group; self-rated scores did
   not change. For NSICU nurses, there were no differences in
   physician-rated or self-rated scores for either group. CONCLUSIONS:
   Surgical intensive care unit nurses who underwent direct observation and
   self-evaluation had improvement in physician-rated NSICU nursing skills,
   likely as these activities allowed for reflective observation in Kolb's
   experiential learning cycle. Greater improvement in participants who
   viewed an instructional video highlights its value as a teaching
   modality for nurses.},

Title = {Evaluation of sustainable, blended learning workforce education for
   suicide prevention in youth services},
Journal = {CHILDREN AND YOUTH SERVICES REVIEW},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {148},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Suicide is the second leading cause of death for youth in the U.S. and
   equipping clinical and non-clinical staff in youth services to address
   suicide concerns is a challenge. This paper evaluates InPlace Learning,
   an innovative and sustainable blended learning approach to suicide
   prevention workforce education in youth services. InPlace Learning
   combines group video-guided workshops, follow-up Q\&A via web-based
   `office hours', and continual learning through job aids and brief
   refreshers. Hillside identified 25 programs to adopt InPlace Learning
   for suicide prevention training, and 1,162 staff to participate in the
   training. The purpose of the first phase of this program evaluation was
   to evaluate the feasibility of this approach, including examining
   adoption and reach of InPlace Learning, as well as education outcomes
   for staff, including knowledge, self-efficacy, and transfer of learning.
   The program evaluation sample consisted of 556 staff who completed
   post-training evaluations. Ten staff shared their experience and
   feedback through post-training interviews. Results show that 100 \% (N =
   25) of programs adopted InPlace Learning and 64 \% of staff participated
   in the training, showing evidence of reach. Post-training evaluations
   indicated participants learned skills in suicide prevention.
   Self-efficacy in connecting around and assessing and responding to
   suicide concerns rose significantly for both clinical and non-clinical
   staff. Non-clinical staff who had lower ratings for self-efficacy before
   training showed the greatest gains post-training. The perception of
   transfer of learning to practice was high. Staff interview data aligned
   with quantitative findings. Taken together, these findings indicate that
   InPlace Learning is a feasible and acceptable approach to suicide
   prevention workforce education in youth services with a positive impact
   on educational outcomes for staff.},

Title = {Effects of Short Video Addiction on the Motivation and Well-Being of
   Chinese Vocational College Students},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {While media use can be beneficial in some ways, excessive use of media
   has led to growing concerns about its potential negative consequences.
   With the popularity of Chinese video applications (apps) such as DouYin,
   TikTok, Kwai, and other short video apps sweeping through schools around
   the world. Due to the diversity and immersion principle of short videos,
   their popularity continues to grow, and the phenomenon of students being
   addicted to short videos also brings many hidden dangers to the learning
   effect. Among other things, the problem of excessive use of the Internet
   among Chinese youth has led the government to propose a series of
   control policies to strengthen the monitoring of harmful habits of youth
   in the use of online applications. In addition, the problem of youth
   addiction to short videos has become a major concern for education
   experts and the general public, thus demonstrating that short video
   addiction is indeed an ongoing research issue. Therefore, this study
   aimed to understand the causes of short-form video addiction and its
   impact on the psychology of learning, and to investigate the
   relationship between short-form video flow experience, short-form video
   addiction, intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation, and learning
   well-being from the perspectives of flow experience theory and micro
   ecological systems. The questionnaire was sent via instant messaging
   software such as QQ and WeChat, and university students from vocational
   colleges in China were invited to complete the questionnaire. A total of
   517 valid data were collected, including 222 (42.9\%) were male students
   and 295 (57.1\%) were female students. The collected questionnaires were
   analyzed for reliability and validity after removing incomplete data,
   followed by structural equation modeling for model verification. The
   findings showed that: (1) short video flow experience had a positive
   effect on short video addiction; (2) short video addiction had a
   negative effect on intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation; (3)
   intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation had a positive effect on
   learning well-being; (4) short video flow experience had an indirect
   negative effect on intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation; (5)
   short video flow and short video addiction had indirect negative effects
   on learning well-being. According to the results, it is clear that
   addiction to short videos has a negative impact on learners' learning
   motivation and positive psychology of learning, so parents and teachers
   should effectively guide students to use short video apps in a
   self-controlled way.},

Abstract = {As known from everyday contexts of multimedia usage, suddenly occurring
   quality impairments are capable of causing strong negative emotions in
   human users. This is particularly the case if the displayed content is
   highly relevant to current motives and behavioral goals. The present
   study investigated the effects of visual degradations on quality
   perception and emotional state of participants who were exposed to a
   series of short video clips. After each video playback, participants had
   to decide whether a certain event happened in the video. For data
   collection, subjective measures of quality and emotion were complemented
   by behavioral measures derived from capturing participants' spontaneous
   facial expressions. For data analysis, two general approaches were
   combined: First, a multivariate analysis of variance approach allowed to
   examine the effects of visual degradation factors on perceived quality
   and subjective emotional dimensions. It mainly revealed that perceived
   quality and emotional valence were both sensitive to degradation
   intensity, whereas the impact of degradation length was limited when
   task-relevant video content had already been obscured. Second, using a
   machine learning approach, an automatic Video Quality of Experience
   (VQoE) prediction system based on the recorded facial expressions was
   derived, demonstrating a strong correlation between facial expressions
   and perceived quality. Hereby, estimates of VQoE might be delivered in
   an objective, continuous and concealed manner, thus diminishing any
   further need for subjective self-reports.},

Abstract = {The following study aims to explore whether a video-and problem-based
   learning (PBL) environment can be improved using cognitive tools. Our
   hypothesis is that direct instructions in a PBL setting enhance
   pre-service teachers' learning outcomes in classroom management. To
   answer this research question, we implemented a pre-post-design within
   which we assigned 237 master students to two learning environments:
   Classic problem-based learning (PBL), where students acquired central
   theoretical concepts and empirical findings on dealing with disruptions
   in groups (n = 113) or instructed problem-based learning (I-PBL), where
   students received extensive theoretical instructions (n = 124) during
   the first two seminar sessions. In the framework of a longitudinal
   self-report assessment we found that (1) teacher self-efficacy in the
   subscales ``student engagement{''}, ``instruction{''} and `` classroom
   management competencies{''} increased in students of both groups. The
   highest increase was found in classroom management competencies. (2) In
   the evaluation with an objective measure students participating in the
   I-PBL group showed greater knowledge than students in the PBL group
   (multiple-choice test), and (3) regarding motivational processes
   students in the PBL group reported a higher degree of identification
   than students in the I-PBL group.},

Abstract = {Introduction New technologies like virtual microscopy have
   revolutionized histology education. However, first-year students often
   require additional assistance with virtual slides. Online self-directed
   learning modules (SDLMs) were developed to provide such support to
   learners by offering them short instructional videos that are uploaded
   to YouTube and the instructional website. The purpose of this study was
   to determine the effectiveness of SDLMs and to sample students' opinions
   about SDLMs. Method Over a 3-year time span, SDLMs were used to augment
   histology lessons, and their effectiveness (on learning outcomes) was
   measured by using traditional steeple-chase and/or virtual slide
   assessments. Average percentage scores for both methods of assessment
   were compared using paired or independent t-tests. Student opinions
   about SDLMs were collected using an anonymous survey. The survey results
   were analyzed by average scores and thematic analysis of the narrative
   responses. Results Using SDLMs in a blended approach showed significant
   improvement in students' academic performance - irrespective of the
   method of assessment. There was a strong positive correlation with the
   performance when students were assessed using the virtual slide method.
   However, a standalone approach using SDLMs did not positively impact
   learning outcomes. Survey results indicated that most students perceived
   the videos as helpful for understanding the subject better and as quick
   review opportunities. Conclusion The results support the use of SDLMs in
   a blended instructional approach and as an adjunct resource to
   conventional microscopy. This use of SDLMs was positively received by
   learners and significantly improved the learning outcome.},

Abstract = {Videos can promote learning by either complementing classroom
   activities, or in self-paced online learning modules. Despite the wide
   availability of online videos in medicine, it can be a challenge for
   many educators to decide when videos should be used, how to best use
   videos, and whether to use existing videos or produce their own. We
   outline 12 tips based on a review of best practices in curriculum
   design, current research in multimedia learning and our experience in
   producing and using educational videos. The 12 tips review the
   advantages of using videos in medical education, present requirements
   for teachers and students, discuss how to integrate video into a
   teaching programme, and describe technical requirements when producing
   one's own videos. The 12 tips can help medical educators use videos more
   effectively to promote student engagement and learning.},

   Blended Learning and Face-to-Face Teaching},
Journal = {ANIMALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Learning surgical skills on simulators is being
   integrated into the curriculum of veterinary students. While education
   has traditionally been face-to-face only, the combination of
   face-to-face and online teaching is described as blended learning. It is
   tested for its suitability for learning a bovine surgical technique. Two
   simulators were developed for the study. While one group of students
   trained on the simulator in a traditional face-to-face setting, the
   other group of students completed online video training. The skills
   learned were applied in-person. The simulators used were tested and
   evaluated by students and practicing veterinarians and were well
   accepted and rated as suitable. The study indicates that blended
   learning can be a suitable alternative to traditional face-to-face
   teaching. In addition, the students were, according to their own
   assessment, more confident in performing the practiced skills after the
   exercise.Abstract Two stimulators were developed, one simplified and one
   realistic, in the present study for learning abomasal surgery for
   veterinary students. The simulators were tested in a pilot study: The
   upcoming blended learning format was compared with traditional
   face-to-face teaching. A total of 21 5th-year students participated in
   the study. While one group learned the surgical technique in traditional
   face-to-face simulator training, the second group completed interactive
   video training asynchronously. Afterwards, skills were examined in
   person. The results showed that the different groups did not lead to
   different performance results. Participation in the study increased
   self-assessment of skills by an average of about 7 of 36 points, as well
   as the learning success and motivation of students in both groups. The
   simulators developed were well liked by the students and rated as
   appropriate by 12 practicing bovine veterinarians. The pilot study
   indicates that blended learning could be a suitable alternative to
   traditional face-to-face teaching. This should be followed by further
   research to support the use of blended learning in the veterinary
   education of clinical skills.},

Title = {Nursing students' self-directed learning experiences in web-based
   virtual simulation: A qualitative study},
Journal = {JAPAN JOURNAL OF NURSING SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Background: Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, virtual reality
   simulation, including web-based simulation, has increased in nursing
   education. This study explored nursing students' self-directed
   problem-solving in web-based virtual simulation experiences.
   Method: Convenience sampling yielded 16 Korean senior nursing students
   who had experienced clinical practice in the last semester. Data were
   collected from August 2020 to January 2021 through in-depth Zoom video
   interviews and organized using NVivo version 12.0. Thematic analysis was
   applied to analyze the data.
   Results: The following four themes were identified from nursing
   students' learning experiences during the web-based virtual simulations:
   ``self-awareness of a lack of nursing competency in virtual reality,{''}
   ``applying new learning strategies learned from failure,{''} ``voluntary
   learning behavior,{''} and ``cognitive shift toward a holistic
   understanding.{''} Web-based virtual simulations activated various
   cognitive and metacognitive factors of self-directed learning, and the
   system's prompt feedback and students' reflections facilitated learning
   effects. Nursing students corrected their cognitive errors while
   learning from their failures and mistakes and gained a holistic view of
   nursing practice.
   Conclusion: In this study, web-based self-directed learning activated
   the metacognition of nursing students in a virtuous cycle. The virtual
   environment with no actual harm to the patient has become a space for
   learners to experience a sense of confidence, achievement, and
   satisfaction. Web-based virtual simulation can be an effective teaching
   method to improve nursing students' self-directed learning abilities and
   nursing competency.},

Abstract = {Extensive empirical research has emphasized the benefits of integrating
   Online Teaching Video Cases (OTVCs) into pre-service preschool teacher
   education. However, there is a research gap concerning the perceptions
   and needs of pre-service preschool teachers regarding OTVCs. This
   cross-sectional study, therefore, investigated pre-service preschool
   teachers' perceptions of usefulness and need pertaining to OTVCs and
   examined potential differences across course year levels. A
   self-designed questionnaire survey was completed by 744 participants
   from the Shandong Province (China), with a focus on five domains: actors
   showcased in the OTVCs, OTVC-mediated activities, learning facilitators,
   situations requiring OTVCs, and areas for improvement. The results
   revealed that the participants identified expert teacher demonstrations
   and collaborative learning experiences with peers and instructors as the
   most useful types of OTVCs. They expressed the need for OTVCs to assist
   them with job preparation and a desire to learn content knowledge and
   engage with larger communities of preschool practitioners.
   Interestingly, the findings revealed significant differences among
   participants of different year levels, with Year 3 participants finding
   OTVCs more useful and necessary in most domains. These findings will
   help preschool teacher educators improve the responsiveness of
   OTVC-based instruction, thereby providing online video resources
   tailored to the preferences and needs of pre-service preschool teachers.},

Abstract = {This document presents the use of a self-video-recording service for the
   integration and assessment of certain generic competences (oral and
   written communication, teamwork and third (English) language) in all
   degree programs related to the Industrial area at the Terrassa School of
   Engineering (EET). The resulting service allows to carry out the
   assessment through active and collaborative learning methodologies using
   ICT as a support, becoming an educational resource where students are
   encouraged to evaluate their own activity, individually and in groups
   (co-evaluation), and with which the faculty can enhance certain sections
   of the syllabus while also evaluating generic competences.
   This paper outlines the rationale and design of the system based on
   self-recording-video that assists work on some generic competences. A
   preliminary experience has taken place and it has been carried out by
   volunteer students and some professors from the promoting team. It
   consisted of following all steps to obtain the video-recording as a
   result and fulfil the further assessment. Preparing the defence of the
   final project career, explaining the way a problem is faced are examples
   of use of the service endowed to assist the assessment of some generic
   competences. A good number of students and professors have participated
   in this preliminary experiment carried out on some subjects and in which
   oral effective communication will be assessed. A specific rubric for the
   assessment of generic competences has been used both for students and
   faculty.
   There is a summary of qualitative feedback from both students and
   instructors, and where several issues related to improving the
   self-assessment and self-video-recording system, are discussed. Finally,
   a survey is proposed, whose results will be helpful for its improvement.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is an instructional model in which basic subject
   matter knowledge is learned prior to in-class sessions, and active
   learning experiences happen in class. To address a gap in recent
   research regarding students' pre-class learning design and its effect in
   flipped classroom, an experimental study was conducted to investigate in
   a flipped classroom course, how pre-service teachers' pre-class learning
   effect differed according to different pre-class learning materials by
   using 1-test. The control group completed their pre-class learning by
   viewing ordinary videos, while the treatment group completed their
   pre-class learning by viewing interactive videos designed based upon the
   Knowledge Integration theory. Both groups have the same instructor,
   classroom learning activities, and learning evaluation methods. This
   study found that the learning achievement, self-efficacy, the
   application of cognitive and the metacognitive skills of the learners in
   the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control
   group. q r addition. the interactive pre-class videos were generally
   well received by the learners in flipped classroom.},

Abstract = {The rise of Information and Communication Technologies and Computer
   Assisted Instruction have led to the adoption of digital visual learning
   aids to improve anatomy instruction. Creation of cadaveric video
   resources surged during 2020-2021 as they provided one option to
   continue teaching anatomy using cadaveric specimens in a time when all
   in-person practical teaching was prohibited to maintain safety during
   the Covid-19 pandemic. Cadaveric videos are relatively inexpensive to
   create and with the correct set up can be filmed independently by one
   anatomist. This makes cadaveric videos a feasible option for anatomists
   to create using their own specimens and tailored to their own
   curriculum. The use of cadaveric videos is not limited to instances
   where practical teaching is not an option and can provide an excellent
   supplementary exercise. Using cadaveric videos in conjunction with
   in-person dissection sessions could enhance student's self-efficacy,
   promote autonomous learning and reduce the likelihood of students
   experiencing cognitive overload while learning in the dissection room
   environment. However, sharing resources that contain cadaveric material
   online should be approached with caution and anatomists should ensure
   they have a secure method of distributing cadaveric video content to the
   intended audience only.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate students' discourse in
   learning mathematics while engaging with the self-regulated learning
   (SRL) strategies, particularly the cognitive learning strategies.
   Participants in this study were a group of Year 9 students in a
   secondary school in the East of England. The data consisted of video
   recording of students' group work sessions at the end of the mathematics
   lesson. The sessions were video recorded, the original work of the
   students was collected and field notes were taken. This was followed by
   the data analysis, whereby the data was analysed for the effectiveness
   and productiveness of students' communication and their engagement with
   the cognitive learning strategies. The Sfard \& Kieran's discourse
   analysis model was employed to analyse students' communication and
   Pintrich's SRL strategies framework was used to analyse students'
   cognitive learning strategies. The findings from this study showed that
   students were involved fully in an effective and productive discourse
   and engaged with the components of cognitive learning strategies. (C)

Abstract = {In this research paper, a cross-sectional study into the effects of
   formative quizzing in higher education and its relation to learning
   performance is presented. For the current study, six online Formative
   Quizzing modules, consisting of texts, graphics and video clips followed
   by two or more test questions to reiterate the material, were provided
   to students. Students could not earn marks and were free to use the
   material, but were informed that in the final examination, questions
   relating to the material would be asked. Data analysis showed that
   students who completed all six modules had a statistical significant
   higher chance to score better on the final examination. This was true
   for high achieving students, but also, and even stronger, for low
   achieving students. The results therefore show in this particular set-up
   a potential causal relationship of online formative quizzing on learning
   performance in higher education.},

Abstract = {In the past years, predictive models in Massive Open Online Courses
   (MOOCs) have focused on forecasting learners' success through their
   grades. The prediction of these grades is useful to identify problems
   that might lead to dropouts. However, most models in prior work predict
   categorical and continuous variables using low-level data. This paper
   contributes to extend current predictive models in the literature by
   considering coarse-grained variables related to Self-Regulated Learning
   (SRL). That is, using learners' self-reported SRL strategies and MOOC
   activity sequence patterns as predictors. Lineal and logistic regression
   modelling were used as a first approach of prediction with data
   collected from N = 2,035 learners who took a self-paced MOOC in
   Coursera. We identified two groups of learners: (1) Comprehensive, who
   follow the course path designed by the teacher; and (2) Targeting, who
   seek for the information required to pass assessments. For both type of
   learners, we found a group of variables as the most predictive: (1) the
   self-reported SRL strategies `goal setting', `strategic planning',
   `elaboration' and `help seeking'; (2) the activity sequences patterns
   `only assessment', `complete a video-lecture and try an assessment',
   `explore the content' and `try an assessment followed by a
   video-lecture'; and (3) learners' prior experience, together with the
   self-reported interest in course assessments, and the number of active
   days and time spent in the platform. These results show how to predict
   with more accuracy when students reach a certain status taking in to
   consideration not only low-level data, but complex data such as their
   SRL strategies.},

Abstract = {In this study, we compared the effectiveness and efficiency of
   self-directed video prompting with and without voice-over narration for
   teaching daily living skills to children with autism spectrum disorder
   (ASD). The participants included four males between the ages of 10 to 14
   years with ASD. We used an adapted alternating treatments design to
   compare video prompting (VP) with and without voice-over narration.
   Self-directed video prompting was effective both with and without
   voice-over narration for teaching, maintaining, and generalizing two
   skills: preparing popcorn and making fresh apple juice. Furthermore, to
   explore the social validity, we examined the views of participants and
   special education teachers who work with children with ASD. All
   participants reported that they enjoyed using a tablet for training and
   liked learning daily living skills. Three of the four participants
   preferred VP with voice-over narration over VP without voice-over
   narration. The teachers stated that the research aims were important,
   the VP was acceptable, and the results were significant. Further
   research is needed to support these findings and determine the factors
   that may be relevant for practitioners considering the use of voice-over
   narration with VP.},

Abstract = {Self-directed delivery modes for continuing medical education (CME) are
   the most effective approaches for improving physician performance.
   However, instructor-directed programs are still the most popular methods

   preferences and barriers to use of nine different CME delivery methods
   by physicians. A self-administered survey of all licensed physicians in
   Nevada was conducted over a three-month period. Results were analyzed
   using SPSS for windows (version 10). In-person conferences (92\%) and
   journal review (64\%) were the most frequently utilized modes of
   instruction. Rural physicians were more likely to use interactive video.
   The top three ranked preferences were in-person conference, print-based
   self-study and CD-ROM. It is concluded that computer training, dedicated
   time in the workplace for self-directed methods, and the development of
   more interactive CD-ROM and Internet programs will encourage the use of
   self-directed CME.},

Abstract = {Although there is evidence that game design can have a positive impact
   on learning and engagement, there are still few studies researching the
   creation of educational games by students, particularly in the context
   of Portuguese schools. This study examines the design of video games by
   8th graders, to teach Mathematics, in a classroom setting, with the
   objective of investigating how designing educational video games affects
   learning and motivation to learn. The research consists in a case study
   with twenty-eight 8th grade students. The students were given a
   preparatory session about educational game design, with a duration of
   three periods of 45 minutes, and then, a month later, eleven 45 minutes
   project sessions to create the games, over the course of a week,
   occurring during their class time. Participants worked in teams and
   designed video games to teach their colleagues about operations with
   bases and exponents (math powers). Multiple data sources were used in
   this qualitative research: participant observation; self-reported
   evaluation of engagement and learning outcomes; group interview with
   students; inquiry to participant teachers; games and game design
   documents. Data was analysed using descriptive statistics and thematic
   analysis. The results showed that all teams were able to design video
   games that represented their understanding of content knowledge, with
   different game mechanics employed, with learning outcomes in terms of
   math contents, game design, technological skills and soft skills.
   Students were motivated by the project, working during their free time
   and showing their creations outside the classroom setting. Game design
   lead to knowledge-building and collaboration. At the end of the project
   there was a sense of competence and accomplishment with students
   reporting being positively surprised by their creations. This paper
   discusses the effects of using educational game design by students as a
   pedagogical strategy, being particularly relevant to inform and guide
   teachers, school decision-makers, researchers and future research
   initiatives.},

Abstract = {Project-based learning is a widely used pedagogical strategy in
   engineering education shown to be effective in fostering
   problem-solving, design, and teamwork skills. There are distinct
   benefits to be gained from giving students autonomy in determining the
   nature and scope of the projects that they wish to undertake, but a lack
   of expert guidance and of a clear direction at the outset can result in
   confusion, frustration, and unfulfilled goals. Moreover, engineering
   schools face the imperative of providing students with opportunities to
   engage with industry during their courses, which can be difficult to
   accomplish due to logistical and time constraints. This paper reports on
   a case study in which undergraduate students of electrical, computer,
   mechatronics, and telecommunications engineering interacted with
   representatives from industry to obtain feedback at the inception phase
   of their design projects. Students pitched their ideas to the industry
   guests at a virtual ``trade fair{''} held within a hybrid video
   conferencing and three-dimensional (3-D) virtual world environment, in
   preparation for the assessable pitches that they had to deliver on
   campus to a faculty audience. Survey and assessment results attest to
   the participants' satisfaction as well as to the effectiveness of the
   approach in improving student self-efficacy and performance. The paper
   concludes with recommendations for engineering educators looking to
   implement similar initiatives and a brief outline of the authors' plans
   for the future.},

Title = {Can In-Home Laboratories Foster Learning, Self-Efficacy, and Motivation
   During the COVID-19 Pandemic?-A Case Study in Two Engineering Programs},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {38},

Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has represented a challenge for higher education
   in terms to provide quality education despite the lockdown periods, the
   transformation of the in-person classes to virtual classes, and the
   demotivation and anxiety that are experimented by the students. Because
   the basis of engineering is the experimentation through hands-on
   activities and learning by doing, the lockdown periods and the temporary
   suspension of the in-person classes and laboratories have meant a
   problem for educators that try to teach and motivate the students
   despite the situation. In this context, this study presents an
   educational methodology based on Problem-Based Learning (PBL) and
   in-home laboratories in engineering. The methodology was carried out in
   two phases during 2020, in the academic programs of Industrial
   Engineering and Technology in Electronics with (n = 44) students. The
   in-home laboratories were sent to the students as part of ``kits{''}with
   the devices needed in each subject. Besides, due to the difficulties in
   monitoring the learning process, the students made videos and blogs as a
   strategy to reinforce their learning and evidence the progress in the
   courses. The outcomes of the methodology show mainly the following
   points: (1) An improvement of the academic performance and learning of
   the students in the courses. (2) A positive influence of the usage of
   in-home laboratories in motivation, self-efficacy, and reduction of
   anxiety. (3) Positive correlations between the usage of in-home
   laboratories, the blogs and videos, and the teacher's feedback for
   learning, motivation, and self-efficacy. Thus, these results evidence
   that other alternatives that gather the cognitive and affective learning
   domains can emerge from engineering to deal with the educational
   problems produced by the crisis periods. Although the methodology and
   the lessons learned in this study are applied to the pandemic period,
   they can be extended in engineering education to the post-pandemic
   period.},

Pages = {350-374},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background/Context: Most of the earlier empirical findings deal with
   motivation regulation in individual learning situations. This study
   identifies higher education students' socially constructed motivation
   regulation in collaborative learning and stresses that regulation of
   motivation is crucial in socially self-regulated learning because
   motivation is constantly shaped and reshaped as the activity unfolds.
   Purpose of Study: The purpose of the study is to identity higher
   education students' socially constructed motivation regulation in
   collaborative learning This was studied by collecting data about the
   students' (N = 16) experiences of situation-specific social challenges
   in collaborative learning groups and observing what the students do to
   overcome these challenges.
   Research Design: The study is a qualitative, multimethod study. Three
   methods-namely, adaptive instrument, video-tapings, and group
   interviews-were used to assess the individual-and group-level
   perspectives on those situations that the students felt were challenging
   and thus possibly activated joint regulation of motivation.
   Conclusions: Motivation regulation can be identified as a socially
   constructed activity, and the importance of regulation of motivation in
   socially self-regulated learning is discussed.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   This study aims to find empirical evidence on how video games can foster
   innovation skills and change perceptions about entrepreneurship and
   general aspects related to the industry in Colombia while innovative
   pedagogical processes in teaching entrepreneurship in higher education.
   Design/methodology/approach
   Based on design-based research, serious games (SGs), entrepreneurial
   education and the innovator DNA framework, the authors collected data
   from undergraduate students enrolled in two online entrepreneurship
   courses at a Colombian university. One course is used as a treatment
   group where students play a video game created for the purpose of this
   research while the other group is used as control where traditional
   learning activities are performed. A self-reported method was used on
   the perceptions of the students after participating in the activities
   through questionnaires to find differences between the mean scores
   reported by both groups.
   Findings
   The results indicate that students who participated in the video game
   reported a higher fostering of their innovation skills and a broader
   change in their perception of entrepreneurship and aspects related to
   the coffee industry, in contrast to the students of the control group.
   Originality/value
   Using a video game created by EAFIT University in Colombia, this study
   responds to an identified need for studying the adequate use of SGs in
   online class contexts and the need of fostering both innovation skills
   and positive perceptions on entrepreneurship among students.},

Abstract = {The design of neuromorphic chips aims to develop electronic circuits
   dedicated to executing artificial neural networks, mainly by exploring
   parallel processing. Unsupervised learning models, such as
   Self-organizing Maps (SOM), may benefit from massively concurrent
   hardware-based implementations to meet the requirements of real-time and
   embedded applications. This work first presents a theoretical analysis
   of the algorithms implemented in hardware to compute SOM learning and
   recall phases. This is important because, albeit similar, the processing
   steps executed in hardware are not necessarily identical to those
   executed in software. Then, the proposed FPGA architecture entitled
   SOMprocessor is shown in detail. The circuit of the processor explores
   two different computational strategies for increasing the performance of
   current state-of-the-art works. These computational strategies aim to
   improve the data flow through the processor and its flexibility to
   implement different network topologies. Finally, this work presents the
   application of the SOMprocessor to a video categorization task. The
   results show that topographic and quantization errors are similar
   between hardware and software implementations, as well as the overall
   accuracy. Moreover, the proposed FPGA architecture achieves acceleration
   of 3 to 4 orders of magnitude as compared to CPU executions. (c) 2020

   development},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN DANCE EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUN 21},
Abstract = {This study demonstrates that videodance has the potential to create a
   paradigm shift in curriculum analysis and the implementation of hybrid
   activities in pre-service teachers at both the individual and group
   levels. Students' critical perceptions, which had previously been
   trained in the domains of videodance, intermedial approaches, and
   cooperative learning, confirm the dimensions of video dance: videodance
   as an expression of language synergies, self-knowledge development
   through the use of technology, intermediality as a didactic resource,
   and the social contextualization of videodance. Pre-service students
   demonstrate their ability to create intermedial items. The outcomes of
   an individual creative education based on the requirements of each
   individual, as well as a collective artistic education based on varied
   interpretations of society, are demonstrated. Videodance generates an
   integrative look of the individual towards oneself, that is, awareness
   of the media (physical and visual) shapes the individual's social
   observation and influences the reproduction of oneself towards the
   world.},

Title = {Flexible e-learning video approach to improve fundus examination skills
   for medical students: a mixed-methods study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 13},
Abstract = {Background: Training for the fundus examination using traditional
   teaching is challenging, resulting in low generalist physicians'
   confidence in performing the funduscopic examination. There is growing
   evidence suggesting a flexible e-learning video approach's value in
   teaching physical examination procedures. However, whether the flexible
   e-learning video approach is superior to the traditional, face-to-face
   (F2F) lecture-based teaching for the funduscopic exam and the cognitive
   processes supporting its effectiveness has not yet been determined.
   Methods: We conducted a sequential explanatory mixed-method study to
   compare the flexible e-learning video approach's effectiveness versus
   the F2F lecture-based approach for teaching the funduscopic exam to
   medical students at Chiba University in Japan. Medical students were
   randomly assigned to either a flexible e-learning video approach group
   or a F2F lecture approach group. We then quantitatively measured the
   diagnostic accuracy of funduscopic findings before and after attending
   the specific classrooms. Next, we conducted student focus groups to
   explore the students' thinking processes in the flexible e-learning
   video approach vs. the F2F lecture-based teaching of fundus examination.
   The qualitative data were analyzed using the qualitative content
   analysis method.
   Results: The mean diagnostic accuracy scores in the post-test
   significantly increased from pre-test in the intervention group (36.6 to
   63.4\%, p < 0.001). Post-post comparisons across the two groups revealed
   a significant difference (intervention group 63.4\% vs. control group
   34.6\%, p < 0.001). Six semi-structured focused group interviews were
   conducted (n = 36). In the flexible e-learning video approach group, we
   identified ten categories corresponding to four levels of the revised
   Bloom's taxonomy: remember, understand, apply, analyze. Five categories
   were identified in the traditional F2F lecture approach group
   corresponding to three revised Bloom's taxonomy levels: understand,
   apply, analyze. Interrater reliability was substantial (Cohen's kappa =
   0.81).
   Conclusions: Teaching medical students funduscopic examination using the
   flexible e-learning video approach leads to improved diagnostic accuracy
   of funduscopic examinations. The flexible e-learning video teaching
   method enabled higher cognitive activity levels than the traditional,
   lecture-based classroom, as assessed using the revised Bloom's taxonomy.},

Title = {Black-box Attack against Self-supervised Video Object Segmentation
   Models with Contrastive Loss},
Journal = {ACM TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA COMPUTING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {20},
Number = {2, SI},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Deep learning models have been proven to be susceptible to malicious
   adversarial attacks, which manipulate input images to deceive the model
   into making erroneous decisions. Consequently, the threat posed to these
   models serves as a poignant reminder of the necessity to focus on the
   model security of object segmentation algorithms based on deep learning.
   However, the current landscape of research on adversarial attacks
   primarily centers around static images, resulting in a dearth of studies
   on adversarial attacks targeting Video Object Segmentation (VOS) models.
   Given that a majority of self-supervised VOS models rely on affinity
   matrices to learn feature representations of video sequences and achieve
   robust pixel correspondence, our investigation has delved into the
   impact of adversarial attacks on self-supervised VOS models. In
   response, we propose an innovative black-box attack method incorporating
   contrastive loss. This method induces segmentation errors in the model
   through perturbations in the feature space and the application of a
   pixel-level loss function. Diverging from conventional gradient-based
   attack techniques, we adopt an iterative black-box attack strategy that
   incorporates contrastive loss across the current frame, any two
   consecutive frames, and multiple frames. Through extensive
   experimentation conducted on the DAVIS 2016 and DAVIS 2017 datasets
   using three self-supervised VOS models and one unsupervised VOS model,
   we unequivocally demonstrate the potent attack efficiency of the
   black-box approach. Remarkably, the J\&F metric value experiences a
   significant decline of up to 50.08\% post-attack.},

Title = {Medical device education: study protocol for a randomised controlled
   trial comparing self-directed learning with traditional instructor-led
   learning on an anaesthesia workstation},
Journal = {BMJ OPEN},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Introduction Continuous professional development is essential for
   maintaining competencies in healthcare. This applies to medical device
   knowledge and safe handling, which are fundamental for patient safety.
   Little is known about the efficiency of self-directed learning with an
   integrated video in medical device education. This study investigates
   whether anaesthesia providers acquire their medical device competencies
   on an anaesthesia workstation differently via self-directed learning
   than traditional teacher-led workshops.
   Methods and analysis This single-centre, non-inferiority, randomised,
   controlled trial aims to enrol at least 224 anaesthesia providers (ie,
   certified nurses and physicians). Participants will be randomised to (1)
   self-directed learning with an integrated learning video (intervention)
   or (2) a traditional teacher-led workshop (control), for a 1-hour
   session on a new anaesthesia workstation. The two educational approaches
   and their effect on medical device competence will be assessed
   concerning 12 competencies in the same 10min, objective, structured,
   clinical examination-like station for both groups. The primary endpoint
   will be an assessment score of >= 60\%. Non-inferiority will be declared
   if the upper limit of a 90\% two-sided CI excludes a difference of more
   than 10\% in favour of the control group. Secondary endpoints will be:
   (1) the score achieved in the study assessment, (2) the number of open
   questions after the training, (3) training time in minutes, (4) use of
   resources and (5) costs, all of which are compared between both groups.
   Ethics and dissemination Study participants will provide written
   informed consent. All recorded data will be stored on a
   password-protected research server at the study site accessible only to
   the investigators. The Bern Cantonal Ethics Committee waived the need
   for ethical approval (Req-2021-00837; 25 July 2021). There are no
   ethical, legal or security issues regarding data collection, processing,

Abstract = {In this study, college students in a large public university in the U.S.
   were surveyed regarding what technologies they use most frequently for
   learning, what technologies they value for learning, and how they
   perceive technology effectiveness to support their learning. The results
   revealed that technology use and value were closely aligned with laptops
   and these were detailed as the most used and valued for learning, which
   underscores the importance of mobile and portable devices in supporting
   anytime anywhere learning. In terms of using software for learning,
   search engines, file-sharing tools, digital libraries, videos, and wikis
   obtained the best results, suggesting that students are adopting
   self-directed, approaches to their learning. Additionally, collaboration
   tools were perceived as the most important for learning which highlights
   the need to design better teaching strategies and learning interactions
   to support collaborative practices that use technology. Overall, the
   majority of participants perceived that technology was effective in
   fostering discussion, collaboration, and interaction. This enable
   experiential learning, supporting organization, planning, and resource
   management, and facilitating a personalized learning experience. The
   results also revealed statistically significant differences between the
   experiences of undergraduate and graduate students about the
   effectiveness of technology. Implications for integrating Web 2.0
   technologies into teaching and learning practices are discussed.},

Abstract = {Reflective writing has been widely recognized as one of the most
   effective activities for fostering students' reflective and critical
   thinking. The analysis of students' reflective writings has been the
   focus of many research studies. However, to date this has been typically
   a very labor-intensive manual process involving content analysis of
   student writings. With recent advancements in the field of learning
   analytics, there have been several attempts to use text analytics to
   examine student reflective writings. This paper presents the results of
   a study examining the use of theoretically-sound linguistic indicators
   of different psychological processes for the development of an analytics
   system for assessment of reflective writing. More precisely, we
   developed a random-forest classification system using linguistic
   indicators provided by the LIWC and Coh-Metrix tools. We also examined
   what particular indicators are representative of the different types of
   student reflective writings.},

Abstract = {The incorporation of Spain into the European Higher Education Area
   (EHEA) has required a thorough change in the university education
   system. For example, teachers have had to strive to develop activities
   that encourage independent, active and collaborative learning. To adapt
   to this new concept of teaching, e-learning and b-learning strategies
   through the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ITC) are
   some of the most used practices.
   The b-learning methodology, which combines face-to-face and distance
   activities, has been implemented in two subjects ({''}General and
   Organic Chemistry{''} and ``Agricultural Chemistry and Analysis{''})
   taught in the Agricultural Engineering Degree at the Technical
   University of Madrid.
   Before the implementation of the new degrees, laboratory classes were
   only performed on-campus because no multimedia material was available.
   In order to give the students the necessary supporting materials that
   favor the autonomous acquisition of knowledge and skills as well as
   increase their motivation and improve their performance, a total of 11
   laboratory practical classes have been recorded in 10 minute videos
   comprising different sections (basic principles, reagents, materials and
   equipment, the use of computer applications, etc.).
   Teachers have evaluated the effectiveness of this method as a learning
   tool as well as its acceptance by students. Students, via the Moodle
   platform for each subject, must watch the video and fill-out a
   multiple-choice questionnaire before being able to carry out the class
   in the laboratory. Once in the laboratory, the teacher will assess the
   students' performance and the results obtained and then, as a final
   step, feedback is provided by the students regarding the usefulness of
   the video and questionnaires.
   The students' results show that the activity allows them to increase
   their sense of ownership of their learning and their motivation and
   improve their knowledge of laboratory techniques and theoretical and
   practical principles. Feedback from the students shows that more than
   80\% believe that the videos enhance the understanding of each practical
   lesson; their duration is appropriate and the multiple-choice questions
   are useful for self-assessment of their learning.},

Abstract = {This study was conducted with first year students of the Grado en

   during the first half of the academic term 2010/2011. The course during
   which the study was performed was Fundamentos Quimicos en Ciencia y
   Tecnolog a de Alimentos (Chemical Bases in Food Science and Technology).
   During the previous term, the teachers of this course had produced an
   educational video to encourage the self-regulated learning of their
   students. Before the recording, some planning was done, and the
   following items were included: aim, introduction, materials, methodology
   and results. The edited video was shorter than 6 minutes.
   The next step to be undertaken was to use the video and evaluate its
   actual effect on the learning process. Our students were encouraged to
   watch it before the practical lesson took place. The student's
   performance in the laboratory was qualitatively observed and compared to
   that of previous students who didn't watch the video. At the end of the
   course, they answered an opinion poll on diverse aspects related to the
   video (usefulness, difficulty, contents...). The results of this
   questionnaire will be commented in this paper.},

Abstract = {Adolescence is the period of growth where major changes occur in all the
   dimensions that make up the human being. Also, the great current use of
   new technologies should be considered, specifically for this age group,
   the video games. The main aim of this study was to explore the
   relationship between the use of a video game in the field of Physical
   Education and the development of self-concept in adolescents, taking
   into account differences by sex. In addition, the effect of the video
   game used in the practice of the individual technique in basketball was
   analyzed. The analyses revealed that there was no improvement in
   self-concept in either the experimental or the control group, but that
   there were differences between sexes. Girls showed a greater improvement
   in physi-cal and emotional self-concept than boys. In the case of
   basketball, there were improvements in individual basketball technique
   in both groups as well as by sex. In this way, it can be concluded that
   the use of video games in adolescence can positively influence the
   improvement of the individual basketball technique and the self-concept

Abstract = {Reporting on the relationship between homework, foreign language
   learning and self-regulated learning, this paper examines how a teacher
   used homework to promote Japanese language learning in a Year 4 class at
   an Australian primary school. The study drew on naturally occurring data
   including classroom observations and student-produced video of
   themselves completing homework as well as interviews and a collection of
   documents and artefacts. Using a sociocultural analytical lens, the
   study found that homework can be a vehicle for the development and
   practice of self-regulation strategies as enablers of successful
   language learning, but only within certain conditions established by
   teachers, parents and the students themselves. The study found that in
   some instances teachers may not recognise or adopt opportunities for
   student self-regulated learning. The paper concludes with a pedagogical
   homework cycle to assist teachers to mobilise the potential of homework
   as a means of scaffolding foreign language learning beyond the
   classroom.},

Abstract = {Weakly supervised Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) using Multi-Instance
   Learning (MIL) is usually based on the fact that the anomaly score of an
   abnormal snippet is higher than that of a normal snippet. In the
   beginning of training, due to the limited accuracy of the model, it is
   easy to select the wrong abnormal snippet. In order to reduce the
   probability of selection errors, we first propose a Multi-Sequence
   Learning (MSL) method and a hinge-based MSL ranking loss that uses a
   sequence composed of multiple snippets as an optimization unit. We then
   design a Transformer-based MSL network to learn both video-level anomaly
   probability and snippet-level anomaly scores. In the inference stage, we
   propose to use the video-level anomaly probability to suppress the
   fluctuation of snippet-level anomaly scores. Finally, since VAD needs to
   predict the snippet-level anomaly scores, by gradually reducing the
   length of selected sequence, we propose a self-training strategy to
   gradually refine the anomaly scores. Experimental results show that our
   method achieves significant improvements on ShanghaiTech, UCF-Crime, and
   XD-Violence.},

Abstract = {The flipped classroom is a successful proposal to address deficiencies
   in the classical educational models, in which content, mainly video
   lectures, is uploaded to the cloud for students to learn on their own as
   homework, and active, student-centered learning activities are developed
   in the classroom to engage students. While there is a consensus in the
   nature of ``homework{''} assignments, mostly web-based audiovisual
   lectures with problems or quizzes, most scholarly research on the
   flipped classroom still debates about which activities are appropriate
   when inverting.
   In order to test such methodology with variations within classroom, the
   authors flipped part of a required fourth-year Sports Science Technology
   course at the University of Alicante, Spain into three distinctive
   groups: pure flipped classroom (G1), a mixed model group (G2) and a
   traditional group (G3). The mixed group took advantage of self-paced
   video content, inherent to pure flipped classroom, and advantage of a
   controlled environment, typical of traditional method at classroom.
   Results showed that there were statistical significant differences
   between the grades of flipped classroom and traditional groups, as
   expected, but also between mixed and traditional groups. Therefore, the
   use of web-based audiovisual content in classroom may be a methodology
   as useful as models outside classroom.},

Title = {Associations between mind wandering, viewer interactions, and the
   meaningful structure of educational videos},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {212},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Over the last years, and especially in the context of the COVID-19
   pandemic, online videos have become an integral part of education.
   Therefore, it is essential to understand how to design such videos to
   provide an efficient and engaging learning experience for the viewers.
   Regarding learning success, the occurrence of mind wandering is of
   particular relevance. Thus, this preregistered research investigates the
   perception of online videos by analyzing the relationship between viewer
   behavior (such as pause button presses), mind wandering, and event
   segmentation by employing logfiles of a large German online video
   platform for educational videos combined with data collected in two
   online studies. Contrary to our expectations, we found a significant
   positive correlation between pausing, seek and resume viewer behavior,
   and mind wandering. Furthermore, replicating previous research, we
   identified a significant positive correlation between pausing behavior
   and meaningful event boundaries in the video. Additionally, a
   significant positive correlation between perceived event boundaries and
   mind wandering was shown. The triangulation of three data sources
   suggests that mind-wandering co-occurs with perceived event boundaries
   and observable, logged behavior (e.g., pressing the pause button). Given
   that the overall mind-wandering occurrence was also positively related
   to self-reported learning, a possible interpretation of the data is that
   event boundaries may trigger task-related mind-wandering that might even
   be conducive to learning.},

Title = {Understanding pharmacokinetics: are YouTube videos a useful learning
   resource?},
Journal = {EUROPEAN REVIEW FOR MEDICAL AND PHARMACOLOGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2014},
Volume = {18},
Number = {13},
Pages = {1957-1967},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether YouTube videos on pharmacokinetics
   can be a useful learning resource for medical students.
   METHODS: YouTube was searched from 01 November to 15 November 2013 for
   search terms ``Pharmacokinetics{''}, ``Drug absorption{''}, ``Drug
   distribution{''}, Drug metabolism{''}, ``Drug elimination{''}, ``Biliary
   excretion of drugs{''}, and ``Renal excretion of drugs{''}. Only videos
   in the English and those matching the inclusion criteria were included.
   For each video, the following characteristic data were collected: title,
   URL, duration, number of viewers, date uploaded, and viewership per day,
   like, dislike, number of comments, number of video sharing, and the
   uploader /creator. Using standardized criteria comprising technical,
   content, authority and pedagogy parameters, three evaluators
   independently assessed the videos for educational usefulness. Data were
   analyzed using SPSS software and the agreement between the evaluators
   was calculated using Cohen's kappa analysis.
   RESULTS: The search identified 1460 videos. Of these, only 48 fulfilled
   the inclusion criteria. Only 30 were classified as educationally useful
   videos (62.5\%) scoring 13.83 +/- 0.45 (mean +/- SD) while the remaining
   18 videos were not educationally useful (37.5\%) scoring 6.48 +/- 1.64
   (mean +/- SD), p = 0.000. The educationally useful videos were created
   by pharmacologists/educators 83.3\% (25/30), professors from two
   universities 13.3\% (04/30) and private tutoring body 3.3\% (01/30). The
   useful videos were viewed by 12096 (65.4\%) and had a total of 433332
   days on YouTube, while the non-educationally useful videos were viewed
   by 6378 (34.6\%) viewers and had 20684 days on YouTube. No correlation
   was found between video total score and number of like (R-2 0.258),
   dislike (R-2 0.103), viewers (R-2 0.186), viewership/day (R-2 0.256),
   comments (R-2 0.250), or share (R-2 0.174). The agreement between the
   three evaluators had an overall Cohen's kappa score in the range of
   0.582-0.949.
   CONCLUSIONS: YouTube videos on pharmacokinetics and drug elimination
   showed a range of variability in regard to the contents of their
   educational usefulness. Medical educators should be aware of the
   potential influence of YouTube videos may have on student's
   understanding of pharmacokinetics and drug elimination. Users who rely
   on the comments made by viewers or the approval expressed in terms of
   the number of like given by viewers should become aware that these
   indicators are not accurate and do not correlate with the scores given
   to videos.},

Title = {Self-Supervised Learning for Semi-Supervised Temporal Language Grounding},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON MULTIMEDIA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Pages = {7747-7757},
Abstract = {Given a text description, Temporal Language Grounding (TLG) aims to
   localize temporal boundaries of the segments that contain the specified
   semantics in an untrimmed video. TLG is inherently a challenging task,
   as it requires comprehensive understanding of both sentence semantics
   and video contents. Previous works either tackle this task in a
   fully-supervised setting that requires a large amount of temporal
   annotations or in a weakly-supervised setting that usually cannot
   achieve satisfactory performance. Since manual annotations are
   expensive, to cope with limited annotations, we tackle TLG in a
   semi-supervised way by incorporating self-supervised learning, and
   propose Self-Supervised Semi-Supervised Temporal Language Grounding
   (S(4)TLG). S(4)TLG consists of two parts: (1) A pseudo label generation
   module that adaptively produces instant pseudo labels for unlabeled
   samples based on predictions from a teacher model; (2) A self-supervised
   feature learning module with intermodal and intra-modal contrastive
   losses to learn video feature representations under the constraints of
   video content consistency and video-text alignment. We conduct extensive
   experiments on the ActivityNet-CD-OOD and Charades-CD-OOD datasets. The
   results demonstrate that our proposed S(4)TLG can achieve competitive
   performance compared to fully-supervised state-of-the-art methods while
   only requiring a small portion of temporal annotations.},

Abstract = {Use of online video lectures is increasingly common. However, students
   may struggle to self-regulate their attention and passively process the
   content. This study examined whether, and for whom, different types of
   embedded learning prompts improve student learning from video lectures.
   Undergraduate physics students (N = 253) watched an online, asynchronous
   physics lecture video as part of their course content. Students were
   randomly assigned to receive embedded cognitive prompts, metacognitive
   prompts, or a no-prompt control condition during the video, then took a
   quiz. A subset of students also reported perceived cognitive load after
   the video. Overall, students who received cognitive prompts exhibited
   higher quiz scores than students in the control condition. Scores in the
   metacognitive prompt condition did not differ from those of either other
   condition, demonstrating a middling effect. Perceived cognitive load did
   not differ between conditions. A subset of students additionally
   completed measures of individual differences in study approaches and
   metacognitive skills. Students who reported having more disorganized
   study approaches benefited the most from cognitive prompts. Individual
   differences in surface/deep processing approaches and metacognitive
   skills did not interact with prompt condition. These findings detail a
   simple intervention to increase cognitive engagement during online
   lectures while not increasing the reported mental effort required. These
   prompts may be most effective for students who otherwise have difficulty
   organizing their study time.},

Abstract = {In e-Learning research, teachers can record lecture videos in e-class
   and upload these lecture videos to e-Learning system themselves. Once
   lecture videos and handouts can be generated automatically in
   traditional classroom, it can help students with self-learning and

   paper proposed a teaching assistant system based on computer vision that
   can help in content development for e-Learning services. Lecture videos
   are taken by using two cameras and merged on both sides so that students
   can see a clear and complete teaching content. The k-means segmentation
   is used to extract board area and then connected component technique
   helps refill the board area which is covered by lecturer's body. Then we
   use adaptive threshold to extract handwritings in various light
   conditions and time-series denoising technique is designed to reduce
   noise. According to extracted handwritings, the lecture videos can be
   automatically structured with high level of semantics. The lecture
   videos are segmented into video clips and all key-frames are integrated
   as handouts of the education videos.},

Title = {A Video-Based Reflective Design to Prepare First Year Pharmacy Students
   for Their First Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE)},

Abstract = {We explored the use of a video-based reflective design in preparing
   first-year pharmacy students for their Objective Structured Clinical
   Examination (OSCE) in Victoria, Australia. This involved pre-workshop
   activities (a recording of themselves simulating the pharmacist
   responding to a simple primary care problem, written reflection, review
   of the OSCE video examples and pre-workshop survey); workshop activities
   (peer feedback on videos) and post-workshop activities (summative MCQ
   quiz and post-workshop survey). These activities took place three weeks
   before their OSCE. A mixed-method study design was employed with
   quantitative and qualitative analyses of the surveys and a focus group.
   A total of 137 students (77.4\%) completed the pre- and post-workshop
   surveys, and ten students participated in the focus group. More student
   participants (54\%) reported feeling prepared for the OSCE post-workshop
   than pre-workshop (13\%). The majority (92\%) agreed that filming,
   watching and reflecting on their video allowed them to learn and improve
   on their skills for the OSCE. The regression analysis found that video
   recording submissions and written reflections correlated positively with
   student OSCE performances, and the video-based reflective design
   learning experience was perceived to be beneficial in multiple ways.
   Thematic analysis of the focus group data revealed that students
   acquired metacognitive skills through the self-assessment of their video
   recordings, developed an awareness of their learning and were able to
   identify learning strategies to prepare for their first OSCE. Fostering
   students' feedback literacy could be considered in future educational
   designs.},

Title = {Shifting the reflective focus: encouraging student teacher learning in
   video-framed and peer-sharing contexts},

Abstract = {Since many studies that use video to support teacher learning are
   situated in strongly guided contexts and encourage particular kinds of
   thinking, we still know very little about how more loosely guided
   contexts can support teachers to think about the dilemmas of practice
   associated with their own goals by reflecting about video. This study
   explores how video-based and peer-based reflections about one's own and
   others' practices both indicate and guide the development of teachers'
   change-directed thinking when they are sequenced before supervisor
   feedback. Six secondary preservice teachers reflected about
   peer-evaluated mini-teaching and videotaped field-based teaching in the
   prestudent teaching term and then about videotaped teaching alone, with
   peers, and alone again with supervisor feedback in the student teaching
   term. These reflections were coded by their subject, degree of
   reform-mindedness, and tendency toward three foci (player, stance, and
   source). Patterns in their higher focus' codes across the three
   reflective resources during student teaching showed how teachers were
   developing the goals they espoused in the fall term. Teachers situated
   their learning in contexts where the degree of scaffolding matched their
   degree of readiness for change, which was better characterized by their
   tendency toward subjects and foci that were less one-sided' than by
   their tendency toward only reform-minded (standards-based) thinking.
   While teachers whose reflections were intermediately different from the
   peer group were better supported by it, most teachers found direct
   support from the self-video and/or peer-video contexts to advance
   change-directed thinking associated with their own goals for teaching.
   The findings reveal not only how goal-related teacher learning can be
   powerfully supported with loosely guided video-framed contexts, but also
   how the diversification and/or expansion of teachers' reflections across
   the categories used in this study provide robust indicators of both the
   content and efficacy of their change-directed thinking.},

Abstract = {Open educational resources (OER), openly licensed teaching, learning and
   research materials are useful tools for teaching, learning and
   assessing. In 2002 the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT, USA)
   launched the Open Courseware (OCW) initiative that allowed publish
   online course materials, providing open and free access to its materials
   for educators, students, and individual learners around the world.
   Since then, the number of courses and the initiatives related to open
   education have constantly growing. At present, more than 260
   Universities and institutions working on open education from around the
   world collaborate in this Consortium, which provides access to more than
   26,000 free online courses. In this context, the concept of Reusable
   Learning Objects (RLO), which can be reused in multiple instructional
   contexts such as the OCW, emerges as independent and self-contained
   learning elements, done in digital format with a pedagogical purpose.
   Some examples of RLO include wikis, videos, podcasts, etc.
   The objective of this paper is to present the methodology and the main
   results achieved to date in a teaching innovation project financed by
   the University of Zaragoza (Spain) during the academic years 2015-16 and
   2016-17. In this project, more than 20 RLO's have been created in the
   form of educational videos under Creative Commons licenses. The aim is
   to promote self-learning and to improve the learning outcomes of five
   subjects in the field of Thermodynamics and Thermal Engineering, which
   are currently taught in three different degree courses. In order to
   assess the teaching-learning process through the educational videos,
   different questionnaires for the students have been designed and
   launched. Initially, all the videos and questionnaires are only
   accessible through a Moodle site to the students enrolled in the five
   subjects. However, at the end of this project, all the educational
   videos will be published within the OCW platform of the University of
   Zaragoza, integrating them in a free and consistent OCW specifically
   designed to support the study of thermodynamics and thermal engineering
   fundamentals. In this way, the project is in line with the ``four R's of
   openness{''} framework, which includes the possibility of reusing,
   redistributing, revising and remixing all the learning objects
   developed.
   So far, the results show that most students are satisfied or very
   satisfied with this innovation experience. In this sense, they consider
   that the use of educational videos has improved their learning process,
   increasing their motivation to study and helping them understand the
   most complicated topics.},

Abstract = {The rapid growth of multimedia data and the improvement of deep learning
   technology has allowed high-accuracy models to be trained for various
   fields. Video tools such as video classification, temporal action
   detection, and video summary are now available for the understanding of
   videos. In daily life, many social events start with a small conflict
   event. If conflicts and the subsequent dangers can be learned about from
   a video, we can prevent social incidents from occurring early on. This
   research presents a video and audio reasoning network that infers
   possible conflict events through video and audio features. To make the
   respective model more generalizable to other tasks, we have also added a
   predictive network to predict the risk of conflict events. We use
   multitasking to render the characteristics of movies and voices more
   generalizable to other similar tasks. We also propose several methods to
   integrate video features and audio features, improving the reasoning
   performance of the model. There's a model we proposed is called the
   video and audio reasoning Network (VARN) which is more accurate than
   other models. Compared with RandomNet, it achieves a 2.9 times greater
   accuracy.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study investigated the potential of Virtual Reality (VR), using
   360-degree (360 degrees) videos, as a tool to teach children about
   water-safety skills. Children (n = 182) aged 10-12 years were randomly
   assigned to learn about water safety using one of three instructional
   mediums: 360 degrees VR videos, traditional video, or poster. The
   training was designed to address specific themes that contributed to
   drowning in coastal environments, allowing children to learn about
   dangers of rip currents in a relatively safe environment. Overall, 95\%
   showed improved knowledge of water safety after participating in the
   water-safety workshop and retained their knowledge during the subsequent
   tests both one and eight weeks later. No difference was found in the
   learning outcomes obtained across the three mediums; however,
   participants in the 360 degrees VR medium reported higher levels of
   interest and enjoyment than participants using the other two mediums
   (91\% of students in the 360 degrees VR video group found the activity
   engaging versus 61\% for traditional video and 51\% for the poster).
   Teacher feedback also indicated that 360 degrees VR videos are a useful,
   engaging, and effective method of learning. Overall, we found support
   for the hypothesis that 360 degrees VR videos are a useful tool to teach
   targeted skills, and that using 360 degrees VR videos is more motivating
   and engaging than using traditional learning methods. We also found
   evidence to support the hypothesis that 360 degrees VR videos are an
   effective tool for self-directed learning.},

Abstract = {Higher educational institutions aim to develop students who take
   responsibility of their own learning. Such students can manage and
   assess their own learning and they often perform better than others.
   Experts believe that one way to develop independent learners are through
   directed independent learning activities which students are required to
   complete with some or minimal supervision from instructors. This paper
   investigates students' perceptions on the use of digitized self-learning
   resources in enhancing students. independent learning. The participants
   of this study were 37 Chemistry students enrolled in the Australian
   Matriculation (AUSMAT) Programme at Sunway College, Malaysia. As part of
   their directed independent learning, participants were provided with
   paper-based self-learning material containing a compilation of
   examination questions on Oxidation and Reduction (Redox) chapter,
   marking key and solution videos provided in a QR code, as well as,
   similar past year questions for practice. Data collection tools were a
   survey questionnaire which consisted of 5-point Likert scale and
   open-ended questions and teacher reflective notes. Analysis of data
   revealed that even though most students favoured the use of digitized
   self-learning resources to support their learning, some were reluctant
   and preferred the use of more traditional methods of learning. The study
   provides valuable insights into the importance of preparing students for
   independent learning and the challenges in preparing digitized
   self-learning resources that would encourage students to become
   autonomous learners.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study explored the impact of integrating digital tools on
   professional preparation in literacy, specifically an online digital
   video portal for teachers' self-observation of instructional practice.
   Methodology/approach - As a design experiment (Bradley \& Reinking,
   2011), a graduate-level Reading Education course was revisioned for
   blended learning to accommodate the professional development of
   practicing teachers in a rural, remote context. This chapter focuses on
   understanding how teachers experience video as a platform for reflection
   on and improvement of practice, with implications for those who seek to
   incorporate digital video into literacy professional development.
   Findings - Through video analysis mediated by the use of a
   self-evaluation guide and a collaborative, online community,
   teacher-learners reflected on their own and their peers' pedagogy and
   language interactions with students. After overcoming initial struggle
   with watching themselves on the video, the close analysis of clips
   became a powerful catalyst for professional growth. Teachers'
   reflections shifted from outward-directed to inner-directed.
   Practical implications - To successfully integrate video analysis in
   Reading Education practicums and professional development for in-service
   teachers, consideration should be given to technical as well as
   pedagogical components. Purposefully building in various scaffolds, for
   example, technical tutorials, prompts to focus video analysis, and safe
   platforms for sharing and collaboration, proved to be beneficial for
   teacher-learners in our courses.},

Abstract = {This study aimed to evaluate the impact of an emergency online learning
   course on students' satisfaction, self-efficacy and achievement. This
   study used a convergent mixed methods approach with an action research
   design to explore students' experiences and outcomes in an emergency
   online science course. This study involved 25 voluntary participants
   from a private college in Manila, Philippines, who were enrolled in the
   Science, Technology and Society online course during the 2019-2020
   academic year. Data were collected using a variety of instruments,
   including questionnaires, reflective journals and semi-structured
   interviews. The results showed that the developed emergency online
   learning course positively impacted students' satisfaction, efficacy and
   achievement. Students were satisfied with their interactions with
   classmates and teachers and the course content. They also expressed
   confidence in their ability to perform online tasks independently and
   master the subject through pre-recorded videos. This study suggests that
   effective student-teacher interaction, peer relationships, relevant and
   relatable course to meet individual learning preferences and teacher
   creativity are essential factors for student satisfaction, efficacy and
   achievement in emergency online learning courses.},

Abstract = {Emerging technologies and student information technology literacy are
   enabling new methods of teaching and learning for clinical skill
   performance. Facilitating experiential practice and reflection on
   performance through student self-video, and exposure to peer benchmarks,
   may promote greater levels of skill competency. This study examines the
   impact of student self-video on the attainment of clinical skills. A
   total of 60 Physiotherapy students (100\%) consented to participate in
   the randomised controlled trial. One group (50\%) was taught a complex
   clinical skill with regular practical tutoring, whilst the other group
   (50\%) supplemented the tutoring with a self-video task aimed at
   promoting reflection on performance. Student skill performance was
   measured in an objective structured clinical examination (OSCE).
   Students also completed an anonymous questionnaire, which explored their
   perception of their learning experiences. Students received
   significantly higher scores in the OSCE when the examined clinical skill
   had been supplemented with a self-video of performance task (P = 0.048).
   Descriptive analysis of the questionnaires relating to student
   perceptions on the teaching methods identified that the self-video of
   performance task utilised contributed to improvement in their clinical
   performance and their confidence for future clinical practice. Students
   identified a number of aspects of the submission process that
   contributed to this perception of educational value. The novel results
   of this study demonstrate that greater clinical skill competency is
   achieved when traditional tutoring methods are supplemented with student
   self-video of performance tasks. Additional benefits included the
   ability of staff and students to monitor longitudinal performance, and
   an increase in feedback opportunities.},

Abstract = {This study examines how videos may support participants' learning in the
   Information and Communication Technology Massive Open Online Course
   (ICTMOOC) aimed to develop digital skills with pre- and in-service
   teachers in Norway and provides an insight into how teachers'
   interactions with videos may contribute to enhancing their agentic
   capacity to learn and transformative digital agency. Analyses of
   participants' interactions with the videos are located in the
   cultural-historical theory and draw on Galperin's conceptualisation of
   learning processes. The data consisted of 501 participants' responses to
   the questionnaire administered to all pre- and in-service teachers
   engaged in the ICTMOOC in 2014-2018. Mixed methods were applied to
   analyse the data by providing quantitative and qualitative evidence
   about the processes of video use. Findings reveal the patterns of
   participants' interactions with videos: (a) seeking explicit information
   about how to engage in learning; (b) seeking assistance while engaged
   with the assigned tasks; (c) support to compare learning outcomes with
   the requirements outlined in the videos. In doing so, the videos
   provided orienting, executive and controlling support and might have
   contributed to enhancing participants' capacity to learn in digital
   environments and their transformative digital agency. The majority of
   participants used videos for executive support and the learners
   preferred videos in the range of 5-10 min. By providing these types of
   support by the videos, a learning activity carries a new function as a
   tool for studying the essence of learning in digital environments. These
   findings have implications for the design of videos in online courses.
   They also emphasise the crucial importance of awareness about the type
   of support videos provide to enhance participants' learning in digital
   environments.},

Abstract = {Learning of clinical dental skills is often difficult for students. Live
   demonstrations are hard for students to visualize and even more
   difficult for them to recognize small details. Even more critical, a
   live demonstration is impossible for a student to rewind and review for
   learning at their own pace.
   Development of a procedural video requires the production team to
   determine ``small{''} steps/scripts of the procedures to be
   demonstrated. Video recording must include clear multi-angle videos that
   emphasizes the three dimensional nature of the procedure. Careful
   editing, voice-over recording (in multiple languages) and development of
   logical ``chapter{''} format are required to allow the student the
   ability to quickly search and view the subject area requiring additional
   learning. Videos are presented in the sequence of the clinical procedure
   with digital chapters permitting quick search and viewing as a
   reference. Unlike a live demonstration, the procedure is presented
   synchronously from multiple angles so that the learner can appreciate
   the actual positioning as it relates to the patient and the individual
   tooth being treated.
   At the conclusion of this presentation attendee will understand the
   value of customized demonstration videos and the fundamentals of how to
   script, multi angle recording of the video and final presentation of
   these videos.},

Title = {SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS' READINESS AND MOTIVATION TO LEARN ENGLISH
   USING SYNCHRONOUS VIDEO CONFERENCES},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Pages = {429-457},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This study aimed at exploring students' online-learning
   exposures involving their readiness and motivation to learn English
   using synchronous video conferences, as well as investigating the
   possible relationship between the readiness and motivation. To fulfill
   these objectives, three research questions were formed: (1) What is
   students' readiness to learn English using synchronous video
   conferences? (2) What is students' motivation to learn English using
   synchronous video conferences? (3) Is there any correlation between
   students' readiness and their motivation to learn English using
   synchronous video conferences?
   Background Due to the urgency of Covid-19 pandemic in the educational
   field, the Indonesian Minister of Education requested that all schooling
   activities must be conducted online as announced in the Learning from
   Home Policy starting on March 24, 2020. In this case, students are
   forced to struggle with the unfamiliar and challenging learning
   situations that their readiness and motivation to learn are worth
   questioning.
   Methodology The participants in this descriptive research, combining
   both a survey and correlation study, were 116 Indonesian high schoolers.
   They came from two different private schools as the particular adaptive
   curriculum has been reshaped and implemented in each school during this
   pandemic. In order to collect the data of students' readiness and
   motivation while they were learning English using synchronous video
   conferences, an online Likert-Scale questionnaire was distributed to all
   participants. Furthermore, a semi-structured interview was conducted to
   dig deeper into students' online-learning exposures.
   Contribution The results of this study can become a reference to create
   an effective and successful online learning environment. This study
   offers fresh and genuine insights coming from students on how ready and
   motivated they were within unfamiliar learning situations. The obstacles
   faced by students are also presented. Three pillars were used to
   construct the questionnaire and to analyze the findings: (1) four online
   readiness factors, (2) ARCS model of motivation, and (3) the Community
   of Inquiry (CoI) framework. Hence, the findings of this research can
   also expand educators' and researchers' knowledge whether the readiness
   and motivation can be improved through the three frameworks.
   Findings This study shows how students' readiness and motivation are
   influenced by unfamiliar situations of synchronous online learning.
   Firstly, students are already confident with their technical skills and
   their familiarity with the use of technology. However, their readiness
   in terms of self-discipline is the lowest. Secondly, students'
   motivation cannot be consistently high because of two drawbacks that
   demotivated them within their online learning. Furthermore, this study
   also found that there is significant positive correlation between
   readiness and motivation. Hence, the readiness and motivation factors
   cannot be simply ignored within the online learning progress.
   Recommendations for Researchers As our findings reveal, Teacher Presence
   is important as it enhances Cognitive Presence and supports students to
   experience Social Presence. Therefore, the roles of teachers that cover
   designing and providing meaningful learning activities, acting as a
   model to engage students in online discussion, employing effective
   strategies to deliver direct instruction and managing class, should be
   completely fulfilled. Instead of consistently sustaining the
   teacher-centered style, teachers may sharpen their technical skills
   along with their pedagogical knowledge. Online learning can be effective
   as teachers could design and implement the student-centered learning
   style in synchronous virtual meetings.
   Recommendations for Researchers Learning from Home is a new policy that
   was published because of the Covid-19 pandemic urgency. The learning
   process happening in a synchronous virtual environment is new for both
   Indonesian teachers and students. Accordingly, more researchers in this
   topic involving a wider level of students coming from rural and urban
   areas are still needed.
   Impact on Society By showing how students' readiness and motivation are
   influenced in the online learning process, this study offers a reference
   that students can have better opportunities of an effective and
   successful online-learning environment. This study also discusses the
   obstacles mostly faced by students. Following the frameworks used, this
   study also gives an opportunity for educators to expand their knowledge
   to take part in solving any problems related to the investigated is
   sues.
   Future Research As technology must still be developing and online
   learning is possibly sustained closely after the pandemic, its
   development must be continuing. As the idea of online learning through
   synchronous meetings is new, issues related to this learning situation
   can still be investigated so that Indonesian teachers can gradually
   create more effective and successful online learning.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate which of three types of video
   resources, and which additional resources, were preferred by Information
   Technology (IT) students for learning and exam preparation. We offered
   three types of video learning resources to support the delivery of a
   first year undergraduate IT course. We collated quantitative data on
   engagement with each video resource through the Learning Management
   System, drew further insights from an online survey of the students and
   combined this with data obtained from an institutional student
   evaluation survey. Whilst there has been much research conducted about
   the use of video lectures and other online resources, there has been
   little research conducted specifically with IT students to determine
   their preferences when selecting learning resources. We report the
   preferences of IT undergraduate students when provided with a selection
   of video learning materials, how the resources were used and their
   perceived learning value. This study not only offers a set of
   considerations and recommendations for the design of learning materials
   for IT students, but also for digital learning in higher-education more
   generally. Short premium videos were watched many more times than full
   lectures, and 85\% of students agreed that short premium videos were
   more beneficial and effective than longer, lower quality lecture
   recordings for their learning. The students' self-assessed video
   attention span varied greatly, with a mean of 10 minutes. Students
   perceived that short premium videos helped them to retain knowledge.
   However, the perceived most useful resource overall was the lecture
   slides.},

   in the training of prospective pre-school teachers. It has been believed
   that the only solution to this problem is to increase the number of
   hours of face-to-face lessons. Our new approach to solving this problem
   is to require students to take videos of their own playing/singing and
   submit them to their instructors. This has led to improved skill in
   performing without increasing the length of face-to-face lessons. In
   order to reduce students' worry about using a complicated system, we
   used ``KS20{''} from Company F, which offers the capability of managing
   information easily. The results of our trials with this approach
   indicated that (1) students who submitted videos 4 or 5 times made a
   significant improvement in their performing skills, and (2) this
   approach was effective in improving basic skills for piano playing and
   singing.},

Title = {Using a video annotation tool to enhance student-teachers' reflective
   practices and communication competence in consultation practices through
   a collaborative learning community},

Abstract = {This study investigated how peer comments made using a video annotation
   tool (VAT) through an online learning community improved
   student-teachers' level of reflective thinking and communication
   competence throughout the simulated (i.e., role-play) context of
   consultation practice. Eighty student-teachers from two classes of the
   course ``Comprehensive School Guidance{''} participated in this study,
   and all recorded two videos for their tripartite practice on parent
   consultation for self-evaluation and peer comment. Forty
   student-teachers were in the comparison class and provided general
   comments to their peers on the learning platform, while those in the
   experimental class used the VAT on the learning platform to provide
   specific comments to their peers. Two post-practice online
   questionnaires and reflective journal entries, which aimed to measure
   communication competence and reflective thinking ability, were
   administered to the student-teachers after the first and second
   consultation practice. The reflective journal entries were segmented
   into units of analysis that were scored using a 4-level model of
   reflective thinking (from 1 to 4), with a higher score indicating
   demonstration of a higher level of reflective thinking for that
   particular segment. Both the number of reflective notes made and the
   average level of reflective thinking in student-teachers' journal
   entries were indicators of reflective thinking ability. Two mixed ANOVAs
   were conducted to examine whether student-teachers in the experimental
   (VAT) class improved their reflective thinking ability and communication
   competence more significantly than those in the comparison (non-VAT)
   class. The results showed that student-teachers in both the VAT and
   non-VAT classes had statistically higher scores for communication
   competence and reflective thinking in the second role-play practice.
   Student-teachers with the support of VAT, in comparison to those
   without, significantly improved their average reflective thinking
   ability. Focus group interviews were also conducted to investigate how
   VAT could support student-teachers' learning process and to learn their
   perceptions of the strengths and limitations of the VAT. The results
   indicated that the VAT could enhance student-teachers' learning by
   reducing communication barriers created by the tendency to avoid direct
   observations of peers' weaknesses, enhancing reflection-in-action during
   practice, and contextualizing written comments by referring to specific
   video segments. However, student-teachers felt that the VAT should also
   allow users to draw on the video screens.},

Title = {Improving students' processing of history-related 360° videos through
   collaboration and emotion regulation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF COMPUTER ASSISTED LEARNING},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {BackgroundWith the increasing availability of immersive technologies
   such as 360 degrees videos for educational purposes, research needs to
   shift from media comparison studies to value-added studies in order to
   identify conditions for effective learning with such technologies. For
   the educational use of history-related virtual reality media, which are
   characterized by immersion and emotionalization, instructional
   approaches that promote cognitive and critical rather than emotional
   processing of the content are required.ObjectivesDrawing on research on
   self-regulated learning, emotion regulation, and collaborative learning,
   the present value-added study examines whether (1) strategy training in
   cognitive and emotion regulation strategies and (2) collaboration can
   enhance students' cognitive processing of history-related 360 degrees
   videos.MethodsIn a quasi-experimental study with school students (N =
   157), we compared the effects of training addressing cognitive and
   emotion regulation strategies with training focusing on cognitive
   strategies alone. Before and during each of the two types of training,
   students were asked to either collaboratively or individually analyse a
   history-related 360 degrees video.Results and ConclusionsTraining in
   cognitive strategies alone promotes cognitive processing of 360 degrees
   videos, while combined training leads to more emotional processing.
   Collaboration helps students to analyse a history-related 360 degrees
   video in a cognitive and reflective way before training and to acquire
   the cognitive strategies during the training. After training, however,
   students who had previously collaborated processed the video more
   emotionally than students who had previously worked alone. This study
   highlights the importance of tailored instructional approaches to
   maximize the educational potential of immersive technologies in history
   education.
   What is currently known about this topic 360 degrees videos have been
   shown to be beneficial but challenging for learning. Emotionalization
   and immersion can hamper the cognitive processing of history-related 360
   degrees videos. Training in cognitive strategies has shown first
   positive effects in this regard. Despite the use of cognitive
   strategies, students tend to unreflectively accept the video content as
   a valid representation of the past.What does this paper add Develops and
   examines a training intervention for cognitive and emotion regulation
   strategies. Explores how collaboration affects the processing of
   history-related 360 degrees videos. Emotion regulation training helps
   students to describe their emotions but not to redirect their attention
   to non-emotional aspects. Cognitive strategy training promotes a
   cognitive rather than emotional processing of the videos. Collaboration
   helps students to acquire cognitive strategies during the
   training.Implications for practice and/or policy When using VR media
   (e.g., 360 degrees videos) for history learning, cognitive strategy
   training should be implemented to support learners' cognitive
   processing. To reflect on their emotions when processing VR, students
   require scaffolding beyond the guidance provided by the emotion
   regulation training tested in this study.},

Abstract = {Background Dividing a surgical procedure into a sequence of identifiable
   and meaningful steps facilitates intraoperative video data acquisition
   and storage. These efforts are especially valuable for technically
   challenging procedures that require intraoperative video analysis, such
   as transanal total mesorectal excision (TaTME); however, manual video
   indexing is time-consuming. Thus, in this study, we constructed an
   annotated video dataset for TaTME with surgical step information and
   evaluated the performance of a deep learning model in recognizing the
   surgical steps in TaTME. Methods This was a single-institutional
   retrospective feasibility study. All TaTME intraoperative videos were
   divided into frames. Each frame was manually annotated as one of the
   following major steps: (1) purse-string closure; (2) full thickness
   transection of the rectal wall; (3) down-to-up dissection; (4)
   dissection after rendezvous; and (5) purse-string suture for stapled
   anastomosis. Steps 3 and 4 were each further classified into four
   sub-steps, specifically, for dissection of the anterior, posterior,
   right, and left planes. A convolutional neural network-based deep
   learning model, Xception, was utilized for the surgical step
   classification task. Results Our dataset containing 50 TaTME videos was
   randomly divided into two subsets for training and testing with 40 and
   10 videos, respectively. The overall accuracy obtained for all
   classification steps was 93.2\%. By contrast, when sub-step
   classification was included in the performance analysis, a mean accuracy
   (+/- standard deviation) of 78\% (+/- 5\%), with a maximum accuracy of
   85\%, was obtained. Conclusions To the best of our knowledge, this is
   the first study based on automatic surgical step classification for
   TaTME. Our deep learning model self-learned and recognized the
   classification steps in TaTME videos with high accuracy after training.
   Thus, our model can be applied to a system for intraoperative guidance
   or for postoperative video indexing and analysis in TaTME procedures.},

Abstract = {In this research, we make a survey of the educational needs and the best
   methods that teachers can use in ``visual education{''} to transmit
   knowledge related to visual art and interact with other subjects,
   converging into a better understanding of programmatic themes in basic
   education. The methodology is based on the content inherent to visual
   art, related to technology and when possible associates with other
   subjects that may be connected like science or language subjects. The
   students `work belongs to a universe between 13 and 14 years old.
   The technologies applied began by making a video which shows the use of
   the platform PLE (personal learning environments) and the use of
   multiple programs simultaneously.
   The video recorded the activities performed by the individual classroom.
   The platform works as a connector between the student and the teacher,
   the school and the outside environment. The three features that allow
   this type of PLE consists in exploiting the Web as communication with
   the outside, through the exhibition of various works done by other
   students or links to relevant pages directed to the content of the age
   group in question. The use of programs is associated with this platform
   enabled extensive range educational activities and a database of
   affected groups in question and finally the feature information
   repository of documents internal or external to the group in question
   and all the professionals who are involved with the students, including
   their guardians too.
   The various multifunction that PLE offers, includes the possibility of
   increasing knowledge assertively without too much students, promotes the
   work in the classroom, stimulates their self-esteem, and helps them
   knowing the work done, gives them evaluation in various contexts,
   obtaining an analysis of its impact both teaching practice and student.
   We seek in this investigation to assess whether the creation of a new
   methodology, combined with rigor and new technology provides a
   competitive advantage to teachers in their daily work, students' lessons
   become more efficient, time is more profitable and contributes to the
   growth of academic success, as well as creating more pleasant lessons,
   where teacher and student are in tune creating a wellness area.
   The platform we use was associated to google, through a private account
   that electronic enabled conducting logistics to the above described and
   enabled parallel evaluation of all our work.
   The observation was made individually in the classroom with a reliable
   and representative sample based on a population of 350 pupils and a
   sampling error of 5\%.
   This investigation was always based on the curriculum guidelines, as
   well as the syllabus for the course. The purpose of this analysis
   focused on three aspects, namely: strengthening professional skills,
   improving teaching practices, building materials and didactic workspaces
   where the welfare is improved for instructors, actors / students.
   In this study the update of scientific and technological knowledge was a
   search for permanent interconnection of the above areas.},

Abstract = {Engagement with video games can potentially advance student digital
   competence however, there is a digital skills gap by the time young
   people progress into adolescence. This current research explores how
   elementary school students' digital self-efficacy might relate to
   experiences in video game environments to influence perceptions of
   digital competence. We examine the differential impact of sex,
   self-efficacy, and socioeconomic status (SES) on 7-10-year-old students'
   (N = 613) perceptions of video gaming and their digital skills. Analysis
   revealed the unexpected finding that SES was inversely related to
   enjoyment for gaming and digital technology, with students in the
   lower-SES category responding more positively compared to students in
   higher SES categories. As expected, boys self-reported digital skills
   higher than girls across all SES categories. We argue for the use of
   gaming pedagogies to support learning in classrooms that accounts for
   nuances in students' digital self-efficacy moderated by gender and SES.},

   cessation training on empathy and self-efficacy of smoking cessation
   counseling: A randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {140},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Empathy and self-efficacy for smoking cessation counseling
   can be enhanced through smoking cessation training. Narrative videos and
   virtual reality (VR) games have been applied in medical education, but
   their application in smoking cessation training is limited and
   understudied. Objectives: To evaluate the effect of smokers' narrative
   videos and mini-VR games on nursing students' empathy towards smokers
   (State Empathy Scale), confidence in practicing empathy, self-efficacy
   in smoking cessation counseling, and learning satisfaction. Design: An
   open-labeled randomized controlled trial, registration number:
   NCT05440877 (ClinicalTrials.gov). Setting and participants: Master of
   nursing students from the University in Hong Kong who enrolled in a
   smoking cessation course. Methods: All students attended a tutorial
   including case-based discussions and role-play. The intervention group
   could additionally access the narrative videos and mini-VR games of
   smokers' cases. Linear mixed models and Cohen's d were used to evaluate
   the intervention effect on the self-reported learning outcomes after the
   intervention. Results: 26 students enrolled in this trial, with 13 in
   each trial arm. All completed the trial. Post-test state empathy scores
   were significantly higher in the control group than in the intervention
   group (Cohen's d = 0.814, p = 0.049). No significant group differences
   were observed in the change of confidence in practicing empathy (beta =
   -11.154, p = 0.073), self-efficacy (beta = 4.846, p = 0.096), and
   students' learning satisfaction (Cohen's d = 0.041, p = 0.917). Both
   groups showed a significant increase in self-efficacy post-test (p <
   0.001). Conclusions: Narrative videos showing smoking scenes and
   reluctance to quit, and our mini-VR games may weaken nursing students'
   empathy towards smokers. Smoking cessation training involving narrative
   videos should be modified. Debriefing and guidance to understand
   smokers' difficulties and express empathy are needed. VR games for
   smoking cessation training can involve more frame stories and
   challenging tasks to increase engagement.},

Abstract = {Under the sudden outbreak of COVID-19 worldwide, students were forced to
   switch from face-to-face to online learning. This study reports the
   experience of Hong Kong students in higher education concerning the
   challenges they faced, the strategies they used and the support they
   needed in their online learning during the period. An online
   questionnaire was used to invite students to answer open-ended questions
   about these three aspects. 145 students from two higher education
   institutions completed the questionnaire and their comments were coded
   using thematic analysis. The study has discovered that socio-economic
   factors may have presented difficulties to students' online learning
   concerning their study environment and access to equipment. Students
   were emotionally distressed by online learning, particularly by the
   quality of feedback and clarity of course arrangement, so support for
   these aspects should be given. Self-regulated learning strategies were
   found to have been deployed by students to facilitate their learning, in
   which the use of time management apps and lecture videos highlights the
   increasing importance of technology to self study. These socio-economic,
   technological and emotional factors will be further discussed and
   corresponding suggestions will be made to help teachers and university
   policy makers examine the conditions that can help improve and promote
   online learning for higher education students under COVID-19.},

Title = {A visual learning analytics (VLA) approach to video-based teacher
   professional development: Impact on teachers' beliefs, self-efficacy,
   and classroom talk practice},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {144},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {To address the challenge of overwhelming data inherent in classroom
   lesson videos, this study proposed a visual learning analytics (VLA)
   approach to video-based teacher professional development (TPD). Using a
   two-year experimental design, 46 secondary mathematics teachers were
   divided randomly into a treatment group (N = 24) and a control group (N
   = 22) to learn about and integrate academically productive talk into
   their teaching. The treatment teachers participated in a VLA-supported
   TPD program, while the control teachers participated in conventional
   knowledge-based workshops. Results show that teachers in the treatment
   group had more positive beliefs and higher self-efficacy in the
   post-test and delayed-post-test, while the control group improved, but
   not significantly, in their beliefs about the usefulness of classroom
   talk. In addition, although the control group made a significant
   improvement in their self-efficacy in guiding classroom talk in the
   post-test, this improvement was not sustained to the delayed post-test.
   Moreover, the coding of classroom teaching behaviour revealed that
   teachers in the treatment group relative to the control group
   significantly increased their use of academically productive talk in the
   post-test lessons to encourage the students' elaboration, reasoning, and
   thinking with others in the classroom. The results suggest that, while
   attending knowledge-based workshops had, to some degree, positive
   effects on the control teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy, these
   effects were not sustainable over time. In contrast, the use of visual
   learning analytics to support the treatment group's reflection on the
   classroom data not only had significant and sustained effects on the
   teachers' beliefs and self-efficacy but also significantly influenced
   their actual classroom teaching behaviour. Implications for designing
   VLA to support teacher learning and professional development are
   discussed.},

Abstract = {The large-scale diffusion of tablets and smartphones in the last decades
   offered new opportunities to broaden educational strategies. In
   particular, the Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL) emerged as a
   promising approach leveraging the widespread availability of portable
   devices. In this study we investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a
   self-administered MALL homework training based on immersive 360 degrees
   videos, compared to a training based on not-immersive standard videos
   showing the same visual content and enriched by an auditory description
   of the environment. The knowledge of target words was assessed before
   and after the training. In addition, students' attitudes toward the
   technology were assessed before the training. Results indicated that
   students with a more positive attitude toward technology watched the
   videos more than those with a less positive attitude. Furthermore,
   students who underwent the training with 360 degrees videos learned more
   words than students belonging to the control group, even after
   controlling for the number of videos views.},

Title = {Exploring Adaptation in Socially-Shared Regulation of Learning Using

Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},

Volume = {27},
Number = {2},

Abstract = {In socially shared regulation of learning, adaptation is a key process
   for overcoming collaborative learning challenges. Monitoring the
   learning process allows learners to recognize the situations that
   require a need to change, revise, or optimize the current learning
   process. This can be done through adapting their strategies, task
   perception, goals, or standards for monitoring their progress. This
   process is called small-scale adaptation. It is not yet clear how shared
   monitoring in groups activates small-scale adaptation ``on the fly{''}
   or how this phenomenon can be detected using multimodal data. The aim of
   this study is to explore how small-scale adaptation emerges during
   collaboration. Video and heart rate data were collected from four groups
   of three high-school students (age 16-17) who worked together during six
   75-min advanced physics lessons. The results show small-scale adaptation
   occurs most often when groups switch from enacting tasks to defining
   them. Physiological synchrony occurred throughout the collaboration and
   was not significantly more prevalent before or after adaptation
   occurred. The opportunities and challenges of combining video
   observation to identify monitoring and adaptation events, and
   physiological synchrony as a possible indicator of ``sharedness,{''} are
   discussed, contributing to the literature about using multimodal data to
   study learning processes.},

Abstract = {The relevance of this article lies in the need to improve the process of
   developing competences future professionals need to develop
   self-employment skills under the conditions of the socio-economic crisis
   and the instability of the Ukrainian labour market. The article aims to
   prove the need for systematic implementation of self-education and
   self-management technologies in Ukrainian professional education schools
   to develop entrepreneurship competence in future professionals. Research
   methods include a survey and an analysis of documentary information.
   Ukraine strives to increase the importance of young people's readiness
   for lifelong learning. However, the article finds that most students do
   not have sufficient psychological knowledge and self-management skills
   for successful self-development and self-employment. The development of
   entrepreneurship competence is, for the first time, justified through
   the systemic implementation of self-education and self-management
   technologies in the educational process of professional education
   schools. The article presents a pedagogical technology for developing
   entrepreneurship competence in future professionals through
   self-management. Besides, it offers the most effective forms of its
   introduction (psychology workshops, video lectures, electronic
   portfolios) and singles out the optimal conditions of their use. The
   level of the technology's readiness is IRL5 (the efficiency was proven
   at the level of experimental educational institutions). Success in its
   implementation depends on the regulatory recognition of the role of the
   social and humanities-related component in professional education; the
   incorporation of a self-management course in all programmes for
   training, retraining and advanced training of psychology and teaching
   staff; the encouragement of teaching staff to effectively use the
   described technologies in the educational process; systematic training
   of students to implement self-education and self-management as the
   technologies of success.},

Abstract = {Nowadays more and more modern medical degree programs focus on
   self-directed and problem-based learning. That requires students to
   search for high quality and easy to retrieve online resources. YouTube
   is an emerging platform for learning human anatomy due to easy access
   and being a free service. The purpose of this study is to make a
   quantitative and qualitative analysis of the available human heart
   anatomy videos on YouTube. Using the search engine of the platform we
   searched for relevant videos using various keywords. Videos with
   irrelevant content, animal tissue, non-English language, no sound,
   duplicates, and physiology focused were excluded from further
   elaboration. The initial search retrieved 55,525 videos, whereas only
   294 qualified for further analysis. A unique scoring system was used to
   assess the anatomical quality and details, general quality, and the
   general data for each video. Our results indicate that the human heart
   anatomy videos available on YouTube conveyed our anatomical criteria
   poorly, whereas the general quality scoring found borderline. Students
   should be selective when looking up on public video databases as it can
   prove challenging, time consuming, and the anatomical information may be
   misleading due to absence of content review. Anatomists and institutions
   are encouraged to prepare and endorse good quality material and make
   them available online for the students. The scoring rubric used in the
   study comprises a valuable tool to faculty members for quality
   evaluation of heart anatomy videos available on social media platforms.

Abstract = {Video games are considered to be promising tools with a considerable
   learning potential. They are supposed to motivate students, promote
   discovery-based learning and empower students to deal with
   ill-structured problems. Since future generations will be ``digital
   natives{''}, they will likely benefit the most from the learning
   potential of educational games. In order to stimulate the use of
   educational games in classrooms and to understand possible barriers and
   enablers, 302 (apprentice) teachers were surveyed in a Flemish
   university and several colleges. The results indicate gender effects,
   with female teachers giving lower scores on several acceptance measures.
   However, testing a structural explanatory model shows that the gender
   effect is strongly mediated via gaming skills, and perceived
   self-efficacy. The lack of gaming experience, gaming knowledge and
   differences in perceived self-efficacy are key issues to understand and
   improve the acceptance of video games as teaching tools. Consequently,
   if video gaming is to be promoted, an information campaign with
   educational guidelines and best practices will be required.},

Abstract = {Objectives: to identify the effect on satisfaction and self-confidence
   of undergraduate nursing students after using a validated bed bath video
   during the simulation. Methods: blinded parallel randomized clinical
   trial. Participants were allocated to the control group (simulation with
   tutor) or intervention (simulation with video). After the interventions,
   the Student Satisfaction and Self Confidence with Learning Scale was
   used to assess satisfaction and self-confidence. The study was approved
   by the Ethics Committee and Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials. Mann
   Whitney, Fisher Exact and Student t statistical tests were used. A
   significance level of 5\% was adopted. Results: fifty eight students
   (30, control; and 28, intervention) were evaluated. There was no
   significant difference between the groups regarding satisfaction
   (p=0.832) and self-confidence (p>0.999). Conclusions: satisfaction and
   self-confidence were similar between the groups, and the two strategies
   could be used in the simulated practice of bed bathing. Descriptors:

Title = {Motorisches Lernen mit digitalen Medien im Sportunterricht - Ein
   digitalbasiertes methodisches Unterrichtskonzept zur Implementierung
   visuellen Feedbacks},
Journal = {GERMAN JOURNAL OF EXERCISE AND SPORT RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 18},
Abstract = {Extensive extracurricular findings regarding the use of video analyses
   for the promotion of motor learning are contrasted by a limited number
   of studies on the implementation of video analyses in school teaching
   practice. As a consequence, methodological concepts for teaching
   practice are still lacking even though progress in digitization is also
   common in the education sector and has been anchored in the education
   plans at curricular level. Against this background, a digital-based
   teaching concept was developed and examined in physical education using
   a closed athletics skill (shot put). Three intervention groups, a visual
   feedback group (IG1: n = 32), a verbal feedback group (IG2: n = 31), as
   well as a self-organized learning group (IG3: n = 32) received
   variations of the methodological approach for four weeks. Technique and
   width were assessed in pretest (week 0), posttest (week 4), and
   retention test (week 11). The methodological concept was able to
   sustainably improve the movement quantity (distance) for all variants
   (Huynh-Feld F ((1.838, 169.110)) = 73.132, p < 0.001, partial eta(2) =
   0.44). The quality of movement (technique) also improved for all
   variants, though post-hoc tests by Games-Howell revealed that IG1 (p =
   0.036) and IG2 (p = 0.005) performed better than the IG3. The retention
   test also indicates significant differences between the groups (F ((2,
   92)) = 3.45, p = 0.036). However, post-hoc tests by Tukey only revealed
   advantages in favor of IG1 (p = 0.027). The results indicate the
   suitability of the methodological concept for teaching practice in
   different variants and thus expand the methodological repertoire for
   teaching physical education with digital media. Furthermore, the results
   underline the added value of externally controlled feedback in the
   context of motor learning, but at the same time also provide indications
   of how and under which conditions self-organized learning can be
   effectively implemented in teaching practice.},

Title = {SPOC online video learning clustering analysis: Identifying learners'
   group behavior characteristics},
Journal = {COMPUTER APPLICATIONS IN ENGINEERING EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {4},
Pages = {1059-1077},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {With the widespread of Small Private Online Courses (SPOC) in colleges
   and universities, course organizers who provide high-quality
   personalized course activities need to understand learners' learning
   status and characteristics, and then optimize the course teaching.
   However, little research has been done on different learners' group
   behavior characteristics, such as which indicators can reflect learner
   groups' behavior, and what are the typical behavior characteristics of
   different learner groups. In this work, we established a Python Language
   Foundation self-built SPOC course, and 109 undergraduates' learning
   behavior data were collected and analyzed. From 74-dimensional behavior
   log data consisting of 72 video-viewing, course video score, and
   comprehensive score, Principal Component Analysis was performed to
   reduce dimensionality. Agglomerative hierarchical clustering was used to
   divide learners into different categories, and the results showed that
   15 groups are clustered. According to the analysis of the four
   indicators for group characteristics, which are the completion and
   viewing-stability of task-point videos, unit test excellence, and
   comprehensive score, it is identified into five primary types, including
   positive type, regular type, negative type, semi-negative type, and a
   fluctuation type. Experiments conducted on a real data set across
   different academic years and courses show that the proposed approach has
   better clustering accuracy and practicability. It is expected that this
   work may be used to strengthen the personalized learning support
   services system in educational institutions and develop a tool that
   integrates exploration and analysis work onto the web platform.},

Abstract = {Parallel and distributed computing (PDC) education is increasingly
   gaining greater recognition as a core topic in undergraduate computing
   degrees. While the application of PDC concepts to software development
   involves the use of highly-technical tools and libraries typically
   reserved for advanced courses, PDC educators are seeking pedagogical
   approaches that can be used to introduce PDC concepts in earlier,
   introductory courses. This study presents such an approach, and aims to
   introduce undergraduate students to fundamental PDC concepts without the
   expectation that they can apply those concepts. The proposed approach is
   inspired by the success seen in the wider computing education
   literature, where analogies and visualization have helped students
   understand other abstract computing topics. The proposed learning
   resources come in the form of a series of short videos, carefully
   aligned to a learning activity that guides towards achieving the
   intended learning outcomes. In addition to being a simple activity to
   complete with students, evaluations illustrate its value even with
   minimal guidance from the instructor. The proposed approach is studied
   as both a synchronous in-class activity guided by the instructor, as
   well as an asynchronous online self-directed activity. These two studies
   produced different outcomes with respect to student learning, revealing
   an important implication for designers of instructional material to
   consider. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Journal = {STUDYING TEACHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {16},
Number = {3},
Pages = {345-363},
Abstract = {Mathematics teacher educators can use video clips of children solving
   mathematics problems to help teacher candidates attend to nuanced
   aspects of teaching and learning mathematics. However, the process of
   selecting and using video clips to support teacher candidates' learning
   to teach mathematics is underexplored as are the ways in which
   mathematics teacher educators can use self-study to examine these
   processes. In this article, we present the Playlist Process - a method
   we developed, using the metaphor of a playlist, to examine our practice
   - and the three insights that emerged during our multi-year,
   multi-institutional collaborative self-study: (1) use explicit scaffolds
   to support the development of teacher candidates' awareness; (2)
   incorporate Torres' Rights of the Learner as a tool for supporting
   teacher candidates' learning about equitable practices; and (3) increase
   attention to grain size and progressions of children's solution
   strategies. The article concludes by considering how the Playlist
   Process can support other teacher educators as they engage in
   self-studies of their practice and collaborate across institutions.
   Implications for future practice and research are included.},

Title = {The emerging phenomenon of L2 vlogging on <i>Bilibili</i>:
   characteristics, engagement, and informal language learning},
Journal = {PROFESIONAL DE LA INFORMACION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {The rise of digital technology has provided new opportunities for
   language learning, extending beyond traditional classroom instruction.
   Video projects have emerged as an effective tool in foreign language
   education, yet research on self-initiated and regulated video production
   for language learning is scarce. This study investigates the phenomenon
   of vlogging in Spanish as a second language on the Chinese video sharing
   platform Bilibili, by analyzing 134 Chinese-produced Spanish-language
   vlogs. The study aims to understand the vlogs' characteristics, the
   vloggers' profile, and the ways they utilize the genre for learning
   Spanish. Through qualitative virtual ethnography, the study uncovers the
   presence and learning engagement of Spanish L2 vlogs on Bilibili. The
   results reveal a diverse range of vlogs, including daily life
   experiences and adaptations of popular YouTube trends, primarily
   produced by university students with advanced editing skills. Vloggers
   incorporate knowledge from both formal education (e.g., the Spanish
   textbook widely used in China, Espanol Moderno) and informal contexts.
   In addition to practicing oral Spanish, L2 vloggers use various forms of
   writing, including Spanish subtitles and Chinese translation, and
   mobilize multimodal resources, such as danmu comments for overlaying
   corrections. Vloggers also adopt discursive strategies for community
   interaction, such as self-deprecating metalanguage, feedback
   solicitation, and metalinguistic reflections. The study highlights the
   potential of video-sharing platforms like Bilibili as tools for language
   learning, reveals different learning styles in digital environments
   (self-supervised and interaction-oriented learning), and indicates the
   direction of integrating daily vlogs and multilingual subtitles into
   language curricula, emphasizing students' agency, self-directed digital
   learning, and transmedia literacy development.},

Abstract = {Objective: US Latinos historically have underutilized end-of-life (EOL)
   resources. This study reports the views of family caregivers before and
   after education intervention Caregivers Like Me geared to improve
   knowledge and attitudes regarding EOL resources among Latino caregivers.
   Methods: This is a qualitative substudy within a multicentered
   cross-sectional study design. Educational intervention was offered to
   family caregivers of Latino elders from 3 different communities, using
   an audiovisual presentation, including a case-based video telenovela and
   pre-posttest questionnaires with open-ended questions. This study
   pertains to the qualitative results for the open-ended questions before
   and after education intervention.
   Results: Participants (N = 145) were mostly females (79\%) with a mean
   age of 56 15 years and reported (92\%) active learning from
   intervention. The pretest open-ended question on expected learning
   identified 2 themes, care for the sick and self-care. It included 5
   subthemes and the most common one was how to help the sick. The posttest
   question on actual learning identified the same 2 themes and 4 subthemes
   that were similar but different from the pretest. Accepting help and
   knowledge of services available were the most common.
   Conclusion: The education intervention Caregivers Like Me was able to
   improve attitudes toward EOL care because participants who wanted to
   help their loved ones realized that they need to accept professional
   help and were made aware of the services available.},

Title = {Enhancing Early Childhood Educators' Skills in Co-regulating Children's
   Emotions: A Collaborative Learning Program},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {The aim of this article is to introduce a research-based work-integrated
   collaborative learning program that focuses on early childhood education
   and care (ECEC) professionals' skills in co-regulation of emotions. The
   collaborative learning program draws on the theoretical framework that
   acknowledges the situated and socially shared nature of regulated
   learning and emotion regulation as well as years of research
   highlighting the importance of versatile and sensitive adults in
   supporting children's learning of regulation skills during their early
   years. The program aims to improve professionals' shared awareness of
   children's emotion regulation development and abilities to identify and
   develop practices that support children in learning these skills, so
   that professionals can provide conscious and consistent co-regulation of
   emotions for children in everyday interactions. The design of the
   program has been developed by considering the aspects of effective
   collaborative and professional learning. This paper focuses on
   describing the theoretical grounding and implementation of a 32-week
   long collaborative learning program for ECEC professionals in Northern
   Finland (N = 450). Also, the development of a video-stimulated
   questionnaire (VSQ) for assessment of professionals' learning during the
   program will be described. VSQ measures professionals' abilities to
   identify and interpret everyday ECEC interactions from the point of view
   of (co-)regulation of emotions. Developing research-based collaborative
   programs that increase systematic support for children to learn
   regulation skills is essential, as these skills affect children's lives
   well into adulthood. They set a basis for children's learning and social
   skills and general wellbeing.},

Title = {Data-driven learning fatigue detection system: A multimodal fusion
   approach of ECG (electrocardiogram) and video signals},
Journal = {MEASUREMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {201},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Fatigue could lead to low efficiency and even serious disaster. In the
   educational field, detecting fatigue could help adjust teaching
   strategies accordingly when a student is inactive, which can potentially
   improve learning efficiency. Despite numerous studies in fatigue
   detection, there is still a lack of multiple classifier systems capable
   of detecting fatigue in daily life (without specific stimulations). To
   initially alleviate this problem, this study develops a learning fatigue
   detection system using a multimodal approach with ECG and video signals,
   classi-fying a learner's state into three categories: alert, normal, and
   fatigued. To validate performance, the proposed system is tested on (i)
   an open-source dataset DROZY (n = 35) and (ii) a self-collected dataset
   captured in a learning environment (n = 92). The experimental results
   based on 10-fold cross-validation demonstrate that the system
   outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a detection
   accuracy of 99.6\% and 91.8\% on the two datasets, respectively.},

Abstract = {Over the past 20 years, the proposal that immersive media, such as video
   games, can be leveraged to enhance brain plasticity and learning has
   been put to the test. This expanding literature highlights the
   extraordinary power of video games as a potential medium to train brain
   functions, but also the remaining challenges that must be addressed in
   developing games that truly deliver in terms of learning objectives.
   Such challenges include the need to: (1) Maintain high motivation given
   that learning typically requires long-term training regimens, (2) Ensure
   that the content or skills to be learned are indeed mastered in the face
   of many possible distractions, and (3) Produce knowledge transfer beyond
   the proximal learning objectives. Game design elements that have been
   proposed to support these learning objectives are reviewed, along with
   the underlying psychological constructs that these elements rest upon. A
   discussion of potential pitfalls is also included, as well as possible
   paths forward to consistently ensure impact.},

Abstract = {Amount and variety of training data drastically affect the performance
   of CNNs. Thus, annotation methods are becoming more and more critical to
   collect data efficiently. In this paper, we propose a simple yet
   efficient Interactive Self-Annotation framework to cut down both time
   and human labor cost for video object bounding box annotation. Our
   method is based on recurrent self-supervised learning and consists of
   two processes: automatic process and interactive process, where the
   automatic process aims to build a supported detector to speed up the
   interactive process. In the Automatic Recurrent Annotation, we let an
   off-the-shelf detector watch unlabeled videos repeatedly to reinforce
   itself automatically. At each iteration, we utilize the trained model
   from the previous iteration to generate better pseudo ground-truth
   bounding boxes than those at the previous iteration, recurrently
   improving self-supervised training the detector. In the Interactive
   Recurrent Annotation, we tackle the human-in-the-loop annotation
   scenario where the detector receives feedback from the human annotator.
   To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Correction module, where
   the annotated frame-distance binarizedly decreases at each time step, to
   utilize the strength of CNN for neighbor frames. Experimental results on
   various video datasets demonstrate the advantages of the proposed
   framework in generating high-quality annotations while reducing
   annotation time and human labor costs.},

Abstract = {The Cognitive Load Theory provides an important perspective for
   observing learning with different online learning technologies. Since
   more and more professional development programs are carried out online
   for in-service teachers, it is crucial to explore their perceived
   cognitive load brought by different online technologies during online
   learning. This study aimed to examine the Extraneous Cognitive Load
   (ECL) and Germane Cognitive Load (GCL) of teachers when learning with
   three online learning technologies (Al chatbot, pre-recorded videos, and
   live lecture). Altogether 220 teachers from different areas and schools
   participated in the study by enrolling on the 21-day online learning
   training about visual thinking tools. The participants reported they
   perceived ECL and GCL using a self-reported scale. The results showed
   that they perceived significantly lower ECL during learning with
   pre-recorded videos than with Al chatbots and live lectures. Meanwhile,
   no significant differences appeared in the GCL among these three online
   learning technologies.},

   datasets were used for analysis and validation. The findings are as
   follows: Firstly, the dropout rate among self-paced students in MOOCs
   exceeds 90\%, with over 50\% of students participating in online
   learning activities for only one day. Furthermore, the starting dates
   for students in the same course differ significantly. Secondly,
   leveraging early learning behavior and relevant background features, the
   proposed early prediction model accurately predicts over 98\% of dropout
   cases and identifies over 50\% of engaged students. Through training,
   the model's convolutional kernels capture meaningful weights for
   different days and activities. Lastly, background features related to
   students and courses have a more significant impact on dropout rates.
   The utilization of resources such as videos and active participation in
   learning activities, like asking questions, demonstrate a particularly
   significant influence on dropout rates. Notably, there is no fixed
   period that consistently affects dropout rates. These method and
   findings provide effective strategies for decreasing dropout rates and
   improving student engagement.},

Title = {Examining the use of prompts to facilitate self-regulated learning in
   Massive Open Online Courses},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {115},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The limited instructional support in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs)
   inherently demands learners to self-regulate their learning. MOOC
   research shows that learners are more successful when they engage in
   self-regulated learning (SRL) behaviors such as planning what to study
   and reviewing study materials. However, many learners struggle with SRL.
   In this study, we examined the effect of two types of SRL prompts (i.e.,
   questions or a combination of questions and recommendations) on SRL
   activities, course engagement, and performance in MOOCs. Learners either
   received questions supporting SRL, questions supporting SRL followed by
   recommendations, or neither questions supporting SRL nor
   recommendations. Log data was used to examine learners' behavior in the
   MOOCs. Results showed the SRL prompts, in general, are effective in
   enhancing SRL-related activities and course engagement. However, the
   effectiveness of the SRL prompts may be influenced by the complexity of
   the MOOCs. The current study adds to the field of SRL by examining
   prompting as an approach to enhance SRL in MOOCs.},

Abstract = {In our field, methodology of the behavioral sciences, we face with the
   need to work with data analysis software that require the purchase of a
   license, who is not within rich of our students. Apart from that,
   adequate knowledge of the use of this software may be essential in their
   future professional activity. If you also add that the establishment of
   the European Higher Education leads us to the adoption of renewal
   processes in the teaching methodology, it's essential to have a tool to
   give guarantees for all of our students to become them who guide their
   own learning.
   The necessity imposed by the new degrees and the extinction of subjects
   in first and second degree course, makes it necessary to facilitate
   self-learning of these subjects to those students who couldn't overcome
   them, because this teaching has been removed.
   In this paper we present the procedure and the development of a dynamic
   multimedia, in which we show different data analysis procedures,
   facilitating the location of different menus and outputs. To do this, we
   used free software Wink (http://www.debugmode.com/wink/) with we were
   capturing the processes that are followed in different statistical
   analysis, and then implement them in a multimedia material created with
   the GNU software Ex-eLearning (http://exelearning.org/wiki). This
   material can be stored in web format for indexing it in personal pages,
   or in SCORM 1.2 format for later upload to a Virtual Classroom under the
   Moodle environment. The generation of this issue facilitates greater
   independence of the student, especially in the basic software of data
   analysis, because different animated gif and videos in the multimedia
   issue guide the student in his study without the need to have such
   software.
   This multimedia material was performed with funding from the Education
   Support Unit of the Universitat Jaume I of Castellon ({''}Unitat de
   Suport Educatiu{''}), and is planned for implementation in the second
   semester of the current course, when the Data Analysis subjects starts.},

Abstract = {This article discusses the process and findings of a study in which
   video annotation (VideoANT) and a learning management system (LMS) were
   implemented together in the microteaching lessons of fourth-year
   geography student teachers. The aim was to ensure adequate assessment of
   and feedback for each student, since these aspects are, in general, a
   shortcoming of micro-lesson facilitation. VideoANT is an online
   environment synchronizing web-based video application with
   timeline-based text annotations, and it was imported into and managed in
   the university's LMS called eFundi. The web videos of the geography
   students' micro-lessons on VideoANT were made accessible by the lecturer
   according to a rotational time schedule managed in eFundi. This enabled
   students to assess fellow students' micro-lessons in a collaborative
   blended learning environment and to receive feedback on their own
   lessons. Qualitative as well as quantitative data were collected, and
   the results indicate that geography student teachers held positive views
   of these technology applications for geography microteaching in
   particular and for their teaching training in general.},

Abstract = {In recent years the use of Web 2.0 applications, including YouTube,
   wikis, social networks, blogs, etc. has spread to all areas, including
   higher education. Among these applications, YouTube is the most used in
   the educational field, being highly appreciated by university students.
   Currently, YouTube has more than 1,900 million users, and it is
   estimated that more than 1,000 million daily hours worldwide are spent
   watching Youtube videos, which are mainly accessed from mobile devices.
   Almost all universities have an institutional channel on YouTube in
   which in addition to disseminating the corporate image and their
   teaching and research activities, some teaching videos used in degree
   studies and Massive Open Line Courses (MOOC) are included.
   This paper presents the main activities carried out in a teaching
   innovation project financed by the University of Zaragoza (UZ, Spain)
   for the development and management of a YouTube channel which has been
   designed as a repository of instructional videos. This video collection
   together with a set of short self-assessment questionnaires has been
   used to support teaching in several related subjects in the field of
   Thermodynamics and Thermal Engineering.
   The paper aims to analyse the visualization statistics of the videos by
   using YouTube and Moodie Analytics, as well as the degree of
   satisfaction of the students with this innovation experience through a
   questionnaire. Likewise, the possible improvements obtained in the
   teaching-learning process are analysed and possible advantages or
   disadvantages associated with the use of videos as a complementary tool
   to traditional teaching are identified.
   The results show a high satisfaction degree among students with the
   videos produced and the self-assessment questionnaires as well as an
   improvement in the learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {Software engineering requires quite a few competences, technical ones
   along with non-technical ones. This talk presents some examples of how
   several interlinked modules in software engineering education were
   modified, refined and enriched over time. Starting out from largely
   instructive lectures, the modules were enriched with activating elements
   that aim at making students discover several relevant issues in software
   engineering by themselves. Thus, they better understand the rationale
   behind the methods and techniques that are available for resolving these
   issues. For instance, students work on a group exercise which clarifies
   that capturing requirements from stakeholders is a communication
   process. This is followed by several additional assignments in which
   student teams prepare and conduct a requirements elicitation session
   with largely realistic external customers. Besides, we offer additional
   learning elements in an adaptive digital learning environment, in
   particular short learning videos. This allows students to revisit topics
   they did not understand properly or to dive deeper into specific issues
   in a self-directed fashion. This is supported by AI technology which
   recommends learning elements that best serve the individual needs and
   characteristics of the individual learner.},

Abstract = {Epidural catheterization has become an indispensable part of modern pain
   therapy, for example, in obstetrics. Learning how to master this skill
   is an important competency. Videos are among the information sources
   with the highest information content for learning such skills. The
   present study aims to analyze videos regarding epidural catheter
   placement provided on the YouTube platform based on a validated
   checklist. An expert workshop selected crucial items for learning
   epidural catheterization in obstetrics. Items were identified and
   optimized in a five-step testing process. Using this checklist, videos
   from YouTube were evaluated by eleven health care professionals. Sixteen
   videos were identified and analyzed. Concerning the
   catheterization-specific part of the checklist, only two videos showed
   satisfactory quality. In the didactic part, eleven out of 21 items
   reached a mean score >50\% of the points. Regarding interrater
   reliability, the catheterization-specific checklist was shown to be
   substantial (Fleiss' kappa = 0.610), and the didactic part was shown to
   be fair (Fleiss' kappa = 0.401). Overall, standard monitoring and
   appropriate aseptic technique were followed in only 42\% and 49\% for
   the procedure. There was a significant correlation between the runtime
   and the content quality (p < 0.001). No correlation could be found in
   terms of platform rating parameters. The video quality varied highly in
   terms of the requirements of this practical skill. The majority appear
   unsuitable for self-study due to serious errors and deficiencies
   regarding patient safety. However, there is no quality control on free
   platforms. Accordingly, it is difficult to identify suitable videos for
   educational purposes.},

Abstract = {Today's society has been paying increasing attention to the important
   impact of family parenting practices on the development of adolescents.
   Adolescents with poor parenting practices may have poor academic
   performance in school, have low self-evaluation, and are more likely to
   be captured by video games and short videos. The present research
   explored the mediating role of fashion values and self-esteem in the
   relationship between a negative parenting style and adolescent learning
   ability. We aimed to deepen our understanding of the relationship
   between family parenting and adolescent value identity, as well as
   between individual self-esteem and school adaptation. We based our
   research on a total of 997 students in Shanghai from grades 6, 8 and 10.
   Furthermore, we made use of parenting behaviour, Chinese adolescent
   values, and of the revised Chinese version of the class drama
   questionnaires and of the Children's self-awareness scale. The chain
   mediation model was used to analyse the mediating effect of fashion
   values and self-esteem on parental rejection and peer evaluation
   learning ability. The results showed that fashion values played a
   partial mediating role between parental rejection and adolescent
   learning ability, and that parental rejection positively predicted
   fashion values, and fashion values negatively predicted learning
   ability. Self-esteem played a partial mediating role between parental
   rejection and adolescent learning ability, while parental rejection
   negatively predicted self-esteem and self-esteem positively predicted
   learning ability. Fashion values and self-esteem played a chain
   mediating role between parental rejection and adolescent learning
   ability, as parental rejection negatively predicted fashion values,
   fashion values positively predicted self-esteem, and self-esteem
   positively predicted learning ability. In conclusion, a negative
   parenting style influenced the development of adolescent value
   recognition and self-esteem, and affected the development of adolescent
   learning ability. That said, we should encourage families to adopt a
   positive parenting style and adolescent quality education to positively
   impact adolescent development.},

Abstract = {The changes that arise from the Bologna Process within the framework of
   the European Higher Education Area have had an impact in the higher
   education teachers' training. More specifically, higher education
   institutions face now the challenge of training teachers who put their
   students at the centre of the teaching-learning process and who are
   capable of engaging them in meaningful learning and reflective thinking.
   To face these challenges, during the 2017-2019 period, the University of
   Barcelona developed an institutional project with five strategic lines
   based on the needs detected among the teachers. These five strategic
   lines were: problem-based learning, flipped classroom (Just in Time
   Teaching and Team Based Learning), gamification, electronic portfolio
   and simulation (evaluative and formative). Within the project, the
   teachers were trained in these strategies as they participated in a
   formative process guided by an expert. This formative process consisted
   in the collaboration of the teachers to design their lessons according
   to one of the strategic lines, the observation of the lessons that their
   colleagues were delivering and, finally, the discussion of what they
   have previously observed.
   Our research followed this formative process to understand its impact
   from the students' perspective. To that end, we observed and
   video-recorded the process, analysed 184 questionnaires from students
   who attended and participated in the lessons designed (34\% from the
   dentistry degree and 66\% from the nursing degree), and conducted eight
   in-depth interviews and two focus groups. However, the results presented
   in this paper respond exclusively to two dimensions related to the
   impact that the different innovations implemented have had on the
   students: the reaction level and the self-perception about the learning
   achieved.
   In general, within the first dimension, it is worth highlighting the
   high satisfaction of the students with the sessions where the
   innovations were applied. The students considered that the innovations
   positively influenced their motivation and allowed them to better
   understand the usefulness of the contents worked. Their greatest
   criticism was the large amount of homework involved, since they were
   accustomed to methodologies in which they adopted a more passive role.
   Regarding the second dimension, the students considered that the active
   role that they needed to display when using these methodologies,
   contributed to engage better with the contents of the sessions.
   In general, we found that the innovation actions carried out had a
   positive impact on the students' learning processes. However, we want to
   highlight a contradictory aspect between the positive evaluation that
   the students made about the active role that these methodologies allowed
   and, at the same time, some discomforts we observed, precisely, in
   relation to the breaking of the regular passive academic culture. These
   results lead us to continue rethinking the ways to make the educational
   agents move towards new ways of being and understanding their learning
   processes in the university.},

Title = {Impact of Video-Based Error Correction Learning for Cardiopulmonary
   Resuscitation Training: Quasi-Experimental Study},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Background: Video-based error correction (VBEC) in medical education
   could offer immediate feedback, promote enhanced learning retention, and
   foster reflective practice. However, its application in cardiopulmonary
   resuscitation (CPR) training has not been investigated. Objective: The
   objective of this study is to assess whether the VBEC procedure could
   improve the training performance of CPR among anesthesiology residents.
   Methods: A quasi-experimental study was conducted among anesthesiology
   residents between December 2022 and April 2023. Primary outcomes
   included a posttraining knowledge test and practical assessment scores.
   Secondary outcomes included the number of residents who correctly
   conducted CPR at each step, the rate of common mistakes during the CPR
   process, and the self-assessment results. A total of 80 anesthesiology
   residents were divided into a VBEC group (n=40) and a control group
   (n=40). The VBEC group underwent a 15-minute VBEC CPR training, whereas
   the control group underwent a 15-minute video-prompting CPR training.
   Results: The posttraining knowledge test score of the VBEC group was
   significantly higher than that of the control group (73, SD 10.5 vs
   65.1, SD 11.4; P =.002). The residents in the VBEC group had lower error
   rates in ``failure to anticipate the next move{''} (n=3, 7.5\% vs n=13,
   32.5\%; P =.01) and ``failure to debrief or problem solve after the
   code{''} (n=2, 5\% vs n=11, 27.5\%; P =.01), as well as better
   performance in the ``secure own safety{''} step (n=34, 85\% vs n=18,
   45\%; P <.001) than those in the control group. The VBEC group showed
   significantly higher confidence in CPR than the control group (n=?,
   62.5\% vs n=?, 35\%; P =.03). Conclusions: VBEC may be a promising
   strategy compared to video prompting for CPR training among
   anesthesiology residents.},

Title = {Does visual attention to the instructor in online video affect learning
   and learner perceptions? An eye-tracking analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {146},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {An increasing number of instructional videos online integrate a real
   instructor on the video screen. So far, the empirical evidence from
   previous studies has been limited and conflicting, and none of the
   studies have explored how learners' allocation of visual attention to
   the on-screen instructor influences learning and learner perceptions.
   Therefore, this study aimed to disentangle a) how instructor presence in
   online videos affects learning, learner perceptions (i.e., cognitive
   load, judgment of learning, satisfaction, situational interest), and
   visual attention distribution and b) to what extent visual attention
   patterns in instructor-present videos predict learning and learner
   perceptions. Sixty college students each watched two videos on
   Statistics, one on an easy topic and the other one on a difficult topic,
   with each in one of the two video formats: instructor-present or
   instructor-absent. Their eye movements were simultaneously registered
   using a desktop-mounted eye tracker. Afterwards, participants
   self-reported their cognitive load, judgment of learning, satisfaction,
   and situational interest for both videos, and feelings toward seeing the
   instructor for the instructor-present videos. Learning from the two
   videos was measured using retention and transfer questions. Findings
   indicated instructor presence a) improved transfer performance for the
   difficult topic, b) reduced cognitive load for the difficult topic, c)
   increased judgment of learning for the difficult topic, and d) enhanced
   satisfaction and situational interest for both topics. Most participants
   expressed a positive feeling toward the instructor. Results also showed
   the instructor attracted a considerable amount of overt visual attention
   in both videos, and the amount of attention allocated to the instructor
   positively predicted participants' satisfaction level for both topics.},

Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {11},

Abstract = {Student engagement allows educational institutions to make better
   decisions regarding teaching methodologies, methods for evaluating the
   quality of education, and ways to provide timely feedback. Due to the
   COVID-19 pandemic, identifying cognitive student engagement in distance
   learning has been a challenge in higher education institutions. In this
   study, we implemented a non-self-report method assessing students' heart
   rate data to identify the cognitive engagement during active learning
   activities. Additionally, as a supplementary tool, we applied a
   previously validated self-report method. This study was performed in
   distance learning lessons on a group of university students in Bogota,
   Colombia. After data analysis, we validated five hypotheses and compared
   the results from both methods. The results confirmed that the heart rate
   assessment had a statistically significant difference with respect to
   the baseline during active learning activities, and this variance could
   be positive or negative. In addition, the results show that if students
   are previously advised that they will have to develop an a new task
   after a passive learning activity (such as a video projection), their
   heart rate will tend to increase and consequently, their cognitive
   engagement will also increase. We expect this study to provide input for
   future research assessing student cognitive engagement using
   physiological parameters as a tool.},

Abstract = {Feedback has been shown to be one of the most powerful and effective
   influences on student achievement; however, the optimal method for
   providing feedback to trainees during veterinary skills training has yet
   to be determined. A prospective mixed-methods study was undertaken to
   evaluate student perceptions and performance outcomes with
   self-assessment using video- or instructor-delivered feedback during
   skills training using a model. Forty participants naive to intravenous
   (IV) catheter placement were randomly assigned either to self-assessment
   using video or to instructor-directed feedback. A questionnaire probing
   participants' perceptions of their knowledge level and confidence in
   their skills was completed before and after the training, and an
   interview was done at study completion. Final skill performance was
   recorded using video capture to permit blind evaluations using a
   standard assessment tool. A quantitative evaluation of the performance
   and questionnaire scores, as well as a qualitative assessment of the
   interviews, was performed. Questionnaire scores were significantly
   higher in the post-study questionnaire for 12 of the 14 questions in
   both groups. Students assigned to the instructor-directed group had
   significantly higher scores than students in the self-directed group on
   the skill performance (p < .05). Self-reported confidence in knowledge
   and skill related to the IV catheterization technique improved with both
   self-directed feedback using video and instructor-directed feedback.
   Skill performance, however, was superior following instructor-directed
   feedback. Participants expressed positive experiences associated with
   use of the models for skills training, the value of the learning
   materials including the video, and guidance during learning.},

Title = {Application of a Printing Design Course Mobile Learning app in a Design
   Course at a Vocational High School: Influence on Self-Regulated Learning
   and Learning Self-Efficacy},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},

Pages = {203-233},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {PurposeThis study investigated (1) the perceptions and attitudes of
   students toward a mobile learning app for a printing design course based
   on the technology acceptance model, (2) how the mobile learning app
   influences learning self-efficacy, and (3) whether self-regulated
   learning (SRL) affects intention to use the mobile learning
   app.HypothesisAccording to the technology acceptance model, behavioral
   intention drives individuals to adopt technology. Behavioral intention
   is influenced by the attitude toward using technology. The perception of
   the usefulness and ease-of-use of new technology also influences an
   individual's decision on how and when to use the technology. SRL is the
   capacity to understand and manage one's own learning environment.
   Individuals with greater SRL may be more inclined to use mobile learning
   apps to enhance their learning experience and increase their
   self-learning efficacy.Therefore, this study integrated SRL as one of
   the factors that could influence behavioral intention to use the new
   mobile learning app. This study proposed five hypotheses to examine how
   various factors influence the willingness to use the mobile learning app
   and how the factors affect learning self-efficacy. The five hypotheses
   are as follows:H1: SRL positively influences intention to use the
   learning app among students.H2: Perceived ease-of-use positively
   influences SRL among students.H3: Perceived usefulness positively
   influences SRL among students.H4: Attitude toward using positively
   influences SRL among students.H5: Behavioral intention positively
   influences learning self-efficacy among
   students.Design/Method/ApproachThis study recruited 34 secondary-year
   students from a vocational high school in Taipei who were enrolled in an
   18-week ``practicum of printing design{''} course. The primary learning
   objective of the course was to learn how to make a photographic album by
   hand. The course has two main sections and was held for two hours every
   week. To assess the effect of app-aided learning, the researchers chose
   the first segment, which comprised essential knowledge of designing,
   printing, and binding. The research team first gained permission from
   the teacher of the course to integrate app learning into his lecturing
   lessons. In the first week, one member of the research team obtained
   consent from students, introduced the app, and assisted students
   download it. Over the next 2-9 weeks, the students used the app in class
   while the researcher conducted classroom observations. At the beginning
   of each class, the teacher explained the learning goals for each day,
   asked students to use the app for 10-15 min, and then held a
   question-and-answer session to facilitate comprehensive understanding of
   the learning contents. The teacher encouraged students to watch videos
   on the app that were related to the course content. In week 10, the
   researcher used a self-developed questionnaire to conduct a survey. The
   questionnaire had six sections: learning self-efficacy, SRL, perceived
   usefulness, perceived ease-of-use, attitude toward learning, and
   behavioral intention. Factor analysis was performed to examine validity,
   and items with a factor loading of <0.5 were eliminated. The
   questionnaire included 20 items that were rated on a 5-point Likert
   scale. Final learning evaluations were also collected.FindingsIn total,
   34 questionnaires were collected for analysis. Due to the small sample
   size, data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation
   modeling. The Cronbach's alpha value ranged was between .70 and .90.
   The average variance extracted for all constructs was > .5. The variance
   inflation factor was < .5 for all constructs. The questionnaire has
   favorable reliability and validity. The R2 value was used to examine the
   explanatory power of the model, and the Q(2) value was used to validate
   the precision of model. The R2 values were 75\% for behavior intention
   and 53\% for SRL. The Q(2) values for behavioral intention and SRL were
   > .50. These results indicate that both perceived usefulness and
   attitude toward using could explain 75\% of the variance in behavioral
   intention and 53\% of the variance in SRL. Perceived usefulness and
   attitude toward using also had a significant ability to predict
   behavioral intention and SRL (both Q(2) values > .50). R-2 and Q(2)
   values for perceived usefulness were 41\% and .29, indicating that
   perceived ease-of-use could explain 41\% of the variance in perceived
   usefulness. Attitude toward using had a lower Q(2) value (.18),
   indicating that attitude toward using the mobile learning app has a weak
   effect on behavioral intention. Path coefficients are the essential
   measures for assessing the structural model. H3 (beta = .63, p < .05),
   H4 (beta = .38, p < .05), and H5 (beta = .60, p < .05) were supported.
   H1 (beta = -.004, p < .05) and H2 (beta = -.23, p < .05) were not
   supported. These findings indicate that perceived usefulness and
   attitude toward using positively influenced SRL, whereas perceived
   ease-of-use did not affect SRL. Perceived usefulness also positively
   influenced behavioral intention.Conclusions and Suggestions(1) This
   study integrated SRL with the technology acceptance model and found that
   perceived usefulness and attitude toward using were the main factors
   affecting SRL. Research has demonstrated that students with greater SRL
   are more likely to proactively facilitate their own learning (behavioral
   intention); however, the results of our study do not support this
   finding. Although mobile phones are commonly used, the students in this
   study seem to not treat mobile phones as a learning tool. Students use
   mobile phones for social connections and entertainment rather than for
   learning. Consequently, their perception of the usefulness of the mobile
   learning app for learning and their intention to use it were low.
   Teachers must first explain the function of the mobile learning app and
   highlight its benefits to encourage students to use it. In addition,
   perceived ease-of-use did not significantly affect the adoption of the
   mobile learning app among students. Given that mobile phones are common,
   their ease-of-use and that of mobile phone apps are not usually an
   issue. Among students, the perceived usefulness of a mobile phone app
   has a greater influence on behavioral intention than perceived
   ease-of-use.(2) Perceived of ease-of-use positively influenced perceived
   usefulness. Perceived usefulness positively influenced behavioral
   intention, and behavioral intention positively influenced learning
   self-efficacy. Although not all these paths were included in the
   hypothesis test, they showed interesting results. Perceived usefulness
   had a greater effect on behavioral intention than the other factors did.
   Behavioral intention was positively correlated with perceived usefulness
   and learning self-efficacy.(3) Attitude toward using positively
   influenced behavioral intention and SRL, which is consistent with the
   findings of previous studies. However, perceived usefulness and
   perceived ease-of-use do not influence attitude toward using.
   These three factors are independent.(4) The findings of this study
   contribute to the field of mobile educational technology and app design.
   This study demonstrated that the perceived usefulness of an app is a
   crucial factor that should be considered during app design. Future
   studies should explore the factors that influence perceived usefulness
   among students. This study had a small sample size from a single class,
   limiting its generalizability. Additional research in different learning
   environments is warranted to gain further insights into how mobile
   learning apps can be improved.},

Abstract = {Objective: To evaluate responses by people with knee osteoarthritis to a
   brief educational video about their condition that aimed to empower and
   motivate effective self-management. The video content addressed
   psychosocial contributors to pain and barriers to behaviour change.
   Methods: A mixed methods design, including a survey and semi-structured
   interviews, was used to collect data from 118 people (46-83 years, 78\%
   female) with knee osteoarthritis.
   Results: Quantitative data analysis showed the video was rated
   positively on 0-6 scales for enjoyability (mean 5.0), helpfulness (4.9),
   relevance (5.0) and believability (5.4). The majority would recommend
   the video (89\%), learned new information (78\%) and/or reported
   intentions to change behaviour (78\%). A minority disliked aspects of
   the video (23\%). The thematic analyses identified three main themes:
   Reactions to the video, including emotions; Learning from the video,
   including new knowledge and empowerment, but also unmet information
   needs or disagreement; and Intentions, including behaviour changes,
   cognitive changes and help seeking.
   Conclusion: Education about knee osteoarthritis with a focus on
   empowerment is well received by people with the condition, although some
   discordant views emerged. Practice implications: The educational video
   about knee osteoarthritis can be recommended to promote effective
   self-management and counteract potential drawbacks associated with
   biomedical-based education. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Learning by writing explanations: Is explaining to a fictitious student
   more effective than self-explaining?},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {74},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Research has demonstrated that oral explaining to a fictitious student
   improves learning. Whether these findings replicate, when students are
   writing explanations, and whether instructional explaining is more
   effective than other explaining strategies, such as self-explaining, is
   unclear. In two experiments, we compared written instructional
   explaining to written self-explaining, and also included written
   retrieval and a baseline control condition. In Experiment 1 (N = 147,
   between-participants-design, laboratory experiment), we obtained no
   effect of explaining. In Experiment 2 (N = 50,
   within-participants-design, field-experiment), only self-explaining was
   more effective than our control conditions for attaining transfer.
   Self-explaining was more effective than instructional explaining. A
   cumulating meta-analysis on students' learning revealed a small effect
   of instructional explaining on conceptual knowledge (g = 0.22), which
   was moderated by the modality of explaining (oral explaining > written
   explaining). These findings indicate that students who write
   explanations are better off selfexplaining than explaining to a
   fictitious student.},

Abstract = {During the worldwide pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19
   pandemic), online learning is increasingly vital for students to learn
   at home, and online learning platforms provide learning opportunities to
   students. The Junyi Academy online platform is an online learning
   platform that both helps lower-achieving students review lessons and
   helps teachers in Taiwan do differentiated instruction. Several studies
   have shown the relationships between students' attention and their
   academic achievements for students' self-learning, but how to best use
   these platforms to help students learn by themselves is unclear.
   Therefore, this study investigates the relationships between students'
   attention and their academic achievements with two online learning
   environments. A total of 38 upper secondary students in Taiwan to
   participate in this study, and these students were divided between a
   Khan-style video lecture (VL) group and an online practice (OP) group.
   This study adopted an experimental design with data collected by an
   electroencephalogram (EEG). The results show that students' attention in
   the VL group was higher than in the OP group. Furthermore, their
   attention in three stages differed between the two groups. Student
   attention was similar in the two groups for the first stage, but the VL
   group had higher attention for the second and third stages was than did
   the OP group. In addition, there was no relationship between students'
   attention and their academic achievements in the VL and OP groups.
   Finally, this study raised some suggestions the future research.},

Title = {Construction and evaluation of a 360 degrees panoramic video on the
   physical examination of nursing students},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {63},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Aim: The aim of this study was to construct and analyze the content
   validity and usability for a 360-degree panoramic video for physical
   examination.Background: Acquiring techniques and ability on physical
   examination (PE) skill is often difficult. Immersion and simulation
   provide an opportunity for nursing students in the real situation focus
   on the PE techniques practice and to improve patient care. The
   combination of digital instructional materials and innovative teaching
   strategies is crucial to improving education. Therefore, effective and
   clear instruction of PE techniques that can enable students confidently
   to use their skills in clinical practice is an issue that nursing
   education must address.Methods: This study used a descriptive research
   design and the technology acceptance model to create a 360 -degree video
   to teach students to perform PE. Content validity and usability were
   analyzed by five nursing teachers and 53 nursing students who had
   completed a physical assessment course were invited to assess its
   usability.Results: The results of the expert review indicated that the
   content validity of the video scored 0.98 in terms of content relevance,
   0.95 in terms of convenience and 0.97 in terms of suitability,
   suggesting that the video was useful and appropriate for
   self-practicing. The experts' qualitative feedback indicated that the
   technical demonstrations in the video were clear and specific and that
   the video was easy to use. The video increased learning motivation and
   streamlined learning. The ability to change the video's perspective also
   increased learning interest. The results of a satisfaction survey were
   8.94 points for perceived ease of use, 8.79 points for perceived
   usefulness, 8.56 points for user attitude toward the video and 9.02
   points for continued intention to use the video, indicating that the
   participants were satisfied with the video. The participants'
   qualitative feedback indicated that each PE technique was clear and that
   the ability to change the video's perspective and zooming was useful and
   novel. Conclusions: The 360-degree panoramic videos were described as a
   positive learning method for physical examination of nursing students.
   It provides easy to use and useful to practice PE technique under
   realistic conditions. Among these outcomes, the 360-degree video can be
   learned best when teaching PE in nursing education. Accordingly, nursing
   educators should construct similar videos for the PE of other parts of
   the body as soon as possible, improve the videos convenience and
   usefulness and promote their ability to strengthen professional skills.},

Abstract = {Our thoughts and feelings towards groupwork and outdoor learning impact
   our subsequent engagement in, and learning from, such activities. This
   study explores the impact of a pre-course video when used in preparation
   for an outdoor groupwork skills course. The video was designed according
   to the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to enhance intentions to
   develop groupwork skills in an international cohort of university
   students. At the induction session of the 3-5 day residential course (N
   = 173), participants were assigned to either video-only, video with
   goal-setting worksheet, or control conditions. Their thoughts and
   feelings towards the course were measured pre- and post-induction and
   their groupwork skills were measured pre- and post-course. In line with
   the TPB, participants' attitudes and self-efficacy towards the course
   were significant and meaningful predictors of their learning intention
   and subsequent behaviour change. These pre-course beliefs towards
   groupwork and outdoor learning were significantly improved by the video,
   despite learners already holding favourable beliefs at baseline.
   However, these high baseline scores meant that improvements in attitudes
   resulting from the video were small, and not enough to enhance the
   subsequent learning outcomes. The potential mechanisms of the pre-course
   video are discussed along with practical implications.},

Abstract = {BackgroundAcademic learning in higher education requires diverse
   activities such as reading, reviewing, and discussion. However, there
   are relatively few studies on the effect of the combination of these
   activities on learning outcomes. In this study, we investigated the
   combination of self-study and discussions at a selective Korean
   university.MethodsThe present study compared the two-part instructional
   sequence of three groups: watching a video lecture (LD) and self-study
   (SD) groups, both followed by student-led discussions, and reviewing
   after watching a video lecture (LR) group. We compared test results
   using verbatim, paraphrased, and transfer items. We also carried out
   in-depth analyses of dialogs in the discussions.FindingsIn three
   separate experiments, we found that the discussion groups scored
   significantly higher than the review group. Moreover, the SD group
   performed better than the LD group of the two discussion groups.
   Analyses of dialogue suggest that self-study elicited more active and
   productive content from the students than lectures, leading to superior
   performance.ContributionOur results indicate that self-study can
   significantly enhance the learning effect of discussions.},

Abstract = {Objectives: To evaluate the effectiveness of 1-h practical chest
   compress inn-only cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) training with or
   without a preparatory self-learning video.
   Methods: Participants were randomly assigned to either a control group
   or a video group who received a self-learning video before attending the
   1-h chest compression-only CPR training program. The primary outcome
   measure was the total number of chest compressions during a 2-min test
   period.
   Results: 214 participants were enrolled, 183 of whom completed this
   study. In a simulation test just before practical training began, 88
   (92.6\%) of the video group attempted chest compressions, while only 58
   (64.4\%) of the control group (p < 0.001) did so. The total number of
   chest compressions was significantly greater in the video group than in
   the control group (100.5 +/- 61.5 versus 74.4 +/- 55.5, p = 0.012). The
   proportion of those who attempted to use an automated external
   defibrillator (AED) was significantly greater in the video group (74.7\%
   versus 28.7\%, p < 0.001). After the 1-h practical training, the number
   of total chest compressions markedly increased regardless of the type of
   CPR training program and intergroup differences had almost disappeared
   (161.0 +/- 31.8 in the video group and 159.0 +/- 35.7 in the control
   group, p = 0.628).
   Conclusions: 1-h chest compression-only CPR training makes it possible
   for the general public to perform satisfactory chest compressions.
   Although a self-learning video encouraged people to perform CPR, their
   performance levels were not sufficient, confirming that practical
   training as well is essential. (UMIN000001046). (C) 2009 Elsevier

Abstract = {Blended Learning (BL) as a pedagogical approach has increased in
   significance during the COVID-19 pandemic, with blended and online
   learning environments becoming the new digital norm for higher
   educational institutions around the globe. While BL has been discussed
   in the literature for thirty years, a common approach has been to
   categorise learner cohorts to support educators in better understanding
   students' relationships with learning technologies. This approach,
   largely unsupported by empirical evidence, has failed to adequately
   address the challenges of integrating learning technologies to fit with
   non-traditional students' preferences, their BL self-efficacy and the
   associated pedagogical implications. Focusing on student preference, our
   study presents findings from a pre-COVID survey of undergraduate
   students across four campuses of an Australian regional university where
   students shared their learning technology preferences and the
   self-regulated learning that influenced their academic self-efficacy in
   a BL context. Findings show students want consistency, relevance, and
   effectiveness with the use of BL tools, with a preference for lecture
   recordings and video resources to support their learning, while email
   and Facebook Messenger were preferred for communicating with peers and
   academic staff. Our study suggests a quality BL environment facilitates
   self-regulated learning using fit-for-purpose technological
   applications. Academic self-efficacy for BL can increase when students
   perceive the educational technologies used by their institution are
   sufficient for their learning needs.},

Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare self-directed interactive video-based instruction
   (IVBI) with instructor-led teaching in the acquisition of basic surgical
   skills by House Surgeons at University of Medicine 1, Yangon.
   DESIGN: A prospective, 1:1 randomized controlled trial was conducted.
   Participants were randomized into 2 teaching arms: (1) self-directed
   IVBI or (2) instructor-led teaching. Self-directed IVBI participants
   were provided with a portable DVD player that could play, fast forward,
   rewind, and skip through skills modules. Participants in the
   instructor-led teaching group were taught in small groups by
   standardized instructors. Pretesting and posttesting of 1-handed knot
   tie, 2-handed knot tie, vertical mattress suture, and instrument tie was
   performed using the Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
   (OSATS). Students randomized to self-directed IVBI completed an exit
   survey to assess satisfaction. Demographic data were collected of all
   participants.
   SETTING: University of Medicine 1, Yangon, Myanmar.
   PARTICIPANTS: Fifty participants were randomly selected from 78 eligible
   House Surgeons who were enrolled in their basic surgery rotation.
   RESULTS: Demographic characteristics and baseline skills were comparable
   in participants randomized to IVBI and instructor-led teaching. Mean
   OSATS score increased from pretest to posttest in both groups (p <
   0.001). The mean posttest OSATS score of the IVBI group was 0.72 points
   below that of the instructor-led teaching group (90\% CI: 3.8 to 5.2),
   with the 90\% CI falling below the a priori noninferiority margin,
   satisfying criteria for noninferiority. More than 90\% of students
   marked either ``agree{''} or ``strongly agree{''} to the following
   statements on the exit survey: further expansion of IVBI into other
   skills modules and integration of IVBI into training curriculum.
   CONCLUSION: IVBI is noninferior to instructor-led teaching of surgical
   skills based on OSATS scores. House Surgeons highly rated self-directed
   IVBI. Self-directed IVBI has the potential to significantly reduce the
   personnel required for skills teaching and may serve as a long-term
   learning adjunct in low-resource settings. (C) 2018 Published by

Abstract = {Problem-based learning (PBL) utilizes a self-directed strategy. This

   curriculum to help address this situation. First year medical students
   participated in this study in the form of a typical PBL session. They
   were then assessed on basic and clinical science knowledge and their
   learning experience. Student basic science and clinical knowledge were
   similar between the student groups. However, the students given a list
   of suggested videos scored higher in their learning experience,
   perception of feeling prepared, and participating in the group PBL
   experience than students who were not given the video list. Results from
   this study indicate that videos can be utilized to enhance the PBL

Abstract = {Although research has demonstrated that an increased rapport between
   instructors and learners can positively relate with increased learning
   gains, perhaps mediated by the positive attitudes toward the course and
   self-efficacy beliefs in the coursework, little has been done to test
   what instructional strategies might increase this rapport in online
   video-based instruction. This study compared online video-based
   instruction that made use of relationship-building strategies with
   online video-based instruction that did not use those strategies. The
   two instructions were identical in every other way. The results show
   that the attitudes of the college students were positively affected by
   the relationship building strategies in a statistically significant way
   (p=.025) and that learning gains were also positively affected at a very
   near-significant level (p=.052). The implications of the findings are

Abstract = {According to educational, pedagogical and neuroscience researches,
   individuals learn in a different way following a particular form or
   style of relation with the external world and with learning. We are all
   involved in a continuous process of learning and it is very useful to
   find out the way we learn analyzing which styles prevail and how to
   develop those styles less used.
   For about two years at the University of Camerino, we have been working
   in the field of pedagogical investigations and exploring learning
   methodologies. These studies, developed as part of PhD research in
   development of new approaches to teaching and learning sciences, led to
   a collaboration with two Spanish leading experts, Catalina Alonso and
   Domingo Gallego, at UNED (Universidad Nacional de Educacion a
   Distancia). Their theoretic framework indicate the existence of 4
   learning styles or learning phases that generate knowledge: active,
   reflective, theoretical, pragmatic.
   A free training activity entitled ``Know yourself. Discover your
   learning styles{''} was designed from the analyses of case-studies
   relating learning styles of undergraduate students of Nutritional
   Biology course. The specific objective of this activity was to support
   students in their own way of learning and thinking through various
   strategies and techniques in order to reduce the large number of
   dropouts in scientific study courses and to improve their academic
   performance.
   This paper illustrates the results obtained by this activity, carried
   out in collaboration with guidance and tutoring services of the
   University of Camerino. The peculiarity of this activity is the
   introduction of students in an innovative way of learning strategies
   developed with the educational methodology of learning styles.
   The activity has been designed and carried out on a ``Moodle{''}
   e-learning platform to provide essential tools that aim to exercise
   critical thinking, using a metacognitive path. The activity encourages
   students towards self-evaluation and self-instruction, and promotes as
   instrument of reflection the questionnaire CAMEA 40 (Cuestionario
   Adaptado para Monitorizar Estilos de Aprendizaje) developed by the
   research group of Madrigal (Politecnico Colombiano Jaime Isaza) and
   Trujillo (Universidad de Granada, Spain). This questionnaire provides
   the profile to be associated with the above discussed 4 learning styles.
   According to Alonso and Gallego, each learning style can be classified
   as follow: very high, high, intermediate, low, very low. The activity on
   the Moodle platform, which is divided in 6 modules, aims to improve all
   learning styles, according to the fact that a quality learning occurs
   only if the 4 styles are employed in the best possible way.
   The theory of learning styles, the contents of the proposed activity
   (study materials, videos, questionnaires, tests and forums) and the use
   of the platform are illustrated through a seminar carried out before the
   virtual course.
   The first edition of ``Know yourself. Discover your learning styles{''}
   involved 79 students attending 3 different Schools of the University of
   Camerino.
   The activity has allowed to make both quantitative and qualitative
   observations. In this work we intend to find out students learning
   styles and to compare the results in terms of correlation between the
   adopted learning styles and the courses attended.},

Title = {Swinging between infatuation and disillusionment: learning about
   teaching teachers through self-study},
Journal = {PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {22},
Number = {4},
Pages = {390-402},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: School teachers who become teacher educators (TEs) are
   rarely prepared for the different pedagogies that teacher education
   requires. One pedagogical difference is the need for TEs to make their
   thinking and decisions explicit to pre-service teachers (PSTs) so PSTs
   can see teaching as an adaptive process rather than a set of routines to
   be memorised.Purpose: This research set out to analyse my learning about
   teaching teachers through making my decisions and thinking explicit to
   my PSTs.Participants and data collection: Using a self-study of teacher
   education practice (S-STEP) methodology, I collected data during an
   outdoor education course in a physical education (PE) degree.
   Participants included a convenience sample of six participating PSTs (of
   a cohort of 24) who participated in four interviews and two group
   interviews. Three critical friends observed five lessons and
   participated in interviews. In addition, self-generated data consisted
   of 104 written reflective journal entries (both private and open).
   Lessons were video-recorded to assist with reflection.Data analysis:
   Utilizing Schon's concepts of reflection for, in and on action, I sought
   out contrary perspectives in order to frame and reframe my understanding
   of TE practice. I then presented these new understandings to other
   participants for further development.Findings: My learning about
   teaching teachers can be represented as swinging between opposite
   extremes of infatuation and disillusionment. After observing my
   teaching, a critical friend identified that my physical position (or how
   I placed myself in the group) affected PST engagement in discussions. As
   I explored this aspect of my teaching further, I became very focused on
   the influence of my physical position to the point of infatuation. My
   infatuation stage culminated in a reflection-in-action moment when I
   changed my position in the act of teaching, which appeared to
   significantly increase PST engagement. But the PSTs challenged my
   interpretation and stated that inequalities of power cannot be resolved
   by rearranging where a teacher stands. In this second stage, I
   experienced a strong sense of disillusionment, even cynicism. As a TE, I
   felt any actions I took were pointless against the power structures of
   society. Later, with insights from participants, I developed a more
   nuanced understanding of power and position; while not a panacea, how I
   arranged myself and the class physically did have some influence on the
   flow of discussions.Conclusions: S-STEP requires that researching
   practitioners challenge their assumptions. In making my own learning
   about my teaching explicit to my PSTs and critical friends, I was able
   to frame and reframe my understandings about teaching teachers. Through
   this research, I discovered that I learnt about my teaching by swinging
   between extremes. I argue that thinking about teaching informed by
   extreme positions, provides a fuller purview of the complexity of
   teaching teachers. S-STEP in conjunction with explicit teaching
   practices offers TEs a tangible means to understand our practices more
   deeply and furthermore, to advance our understanding of teacher
   education more broadly.},

Title = {Self-regulation and emotion matter: A case study of instructor
   interactions with a learning analytics dashboard},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {161},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is providing new methodologies that are being
   applied to the design and application of dashboards to support teaching
   and learning. However, few studies attempt to understand how instructors
   interact with an LA dashboard and how self-regulated learning (SRL)
   activities and emotions of instructors occur and co-occur in the
   interaction. The current study investigates ten instructors' SRL
   activities and epistemic emotions by analyzing the screen capture videos
   and think-aloud data while they interact with an LA dashboard designed
   to support the online asynchronous collaboration of multiple groups. The
   results reveal that instructors demonstrated two ways of navigating LA
   dashboards, and they relied heavily on the conversation explorer
   feature. Instructors were mostly engaged in elaboration, monitoring, and
   evaluation activities and they frequently experienced confusion and
   enjoyment. Expert instructors were more likely to refer to their
   personal teaching experience and demonstrated more epistemic emotions
   than novice instructors. This study contributes to the literature on SRL
   and teacher emotions by revealing the critical role of elaboration,
   monitoring, evaluation, and epistemic emotions when instructors attempt
   to understand a LA dashboard by themselves. These findings highlight the
   importance of providing pedagogical assistance to teachers who are
   trying to navigate between group dynamics and visualizations viewed
   using LA dashboards.},

Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Applying new methods of clinical education seems to provide
   nursing students with educational opportunities. The present study aimed
   to compare the effectiveness of training through demonstration, video
   display, and virtual social space on the learning of clinical skills
   among nursing students.
   MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this semi-experimental research with posttest
   that was performed in 2019, thirty nursing students of the seventh
   semester were randomly assigned to three groups of demonstration, video
   display, and the social virtual space education with ten people in each
   group. The research was conducted in the hemodialysis ward of university
   hospitals. Each group was trained and evaluated during 10 days with 5-h
   sessions continuously. Participants' skills were evaluated using eight
   self-made, valid and reliable checklists, and the three groups were
   compared. For data analysis such as the means and standard deviations
   and inferential statistics, Mann-Whitney test, Kruskal-Wallis
   likelihood-ratio, and Chi-squared test in SPSS version 16 were used.
   RESULTS: The results indicated that practical skill levels in the group
   of virtual social network were significantly higher than the two groups
   of video display (P = 0.045) and demonstration (P = 0.03). In addition,
   the group of virtual space had significantly higher scores than those of
   the other two groups only in two skills of ``prime{''} and
   ``disconnecting the patients from the machine{''} (P < 0.05).
   CONCLUSION: Proper use of networks and social virtual space for clinical
   training, along with conventional methods of learning, provides good
   learning opportunities and is affordable in terms of time, cost, and
   process.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study was to examine the effect of game for
   understanding through the ``Play and Stay{''} modification form of
   practice, on learning the tennis backhand skill by Elementary School
   students and their self-efficacy improvement. Fifty four (N=54) fourth
   grade Elementary students, aged 9 to 10 years (M=9.13, SD=0.21)
   participated. The students from two elementary schools were divided into
   two groups: the experimental group (N=27) which followed the ``Play and
   Stay{''}, and the control group (N=27) which followed the traditional
   teaching method. The three-week course was held during the Physical
   Education lessons, (3 hours/week). A qualitative evaluation of the
   technique (ten trials-video-recording, observation, and a 5-element
   assessment), and a quantitative evaluation of backhand stroke were used,
   comprising of a pre-test, a post-test, and a retention test one week
   after the completion of the interventions. Self-efficacy was assessed
   before and at the end of the interventions, by a 5-item questionnaire
   (Theodorakis, 1996). ANOVA repeated measures (2 groups X 3 measurements)
   revealed a significant interaction between groups and measurements for
   both qualitative and quantitative performance of backhand skill. ANOVA
   repeated measures (2 groups X 2 measurements) also revealed a
   significant interaction between groups and measurements for
   self-efficacy. Post hoc analyses indicated that only ``Play and Stay{''}

Abstract = {At present, the security of the Internet of things (IoT) has aroused
   great concern in artificial intelligence area, Artificial Intelligence
   of Things (AIoT) are widely used in various intelligent surveillance
   scenarios. However, due to the weak interpretability of the model and
   high data security risks, developing a robust and explainable deep
   learning network framework for scene understanding under AIoT is
   extremely difficult. In addition, the fusion of IoT and AI also poses
   several challenges. To solve these difficulties, we develop a
   self-learning and explainable deep learning network toward the security
   of AIoT. The constructed system contains video collection, upload and
   display as well as data analysis and early warning operation at the
   embedded device end, and automatically recognizes the behaviors of scene
   by our developed visual recognition algorithms. In addition, the cloud
   computing platform can be controlled through our developed network. Our
   developed visual recognition algorithms contribute to three aspects.
   First, we propose a lightweight reinforcement learning network model by
   extracting spatial-temporal feature of different behavior
   characteristic. Then, we propose a self-paced learning framework through
   fusing the deep reinforcement learning and transfer learning. Finally,
   we propose a multi-perspective deep transfer learning model to solve the
   problem of weak explanation of model. The experimental results show that
   our proposed model is able to provide high interpretability of model and
   outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {The article deals with the applications of various video materials at
   the classes of English language for EFL (English as a foreign language)
   learners at Kazan Federal University, Russia.
   Authentic videos of different kinds (tutorials, short educative films,
   feature films, and documentaries) are traditionally perceived as the way
   of acquiring good listening and communication skills since they
   artificially create the English language environment.
   The paper discusses the experience of applying video materials for both
   teaching students in the classroom, and as a way of self-study for the
   most motivated learners. The issue is topical due to the recent
   reduction of the classroom hours and consequent increase of the time
   given for self-study. The article also argues the educational potential
   of the self-made videos, presented at the English classes as students'
   projects. Furthermore, creating video courses for teaching EFL is
   explored. The paper specifies the students' needs in terms of the new
   learning environment.
   The listed ways of implementing videos to the English class are
   described from the point of view of their applicability and efficiency
   in developing English language skills.
   The results of the research could be applied by the teachers of English
   as a foreign language, who include videos as the source of authentic
   language into their courses.},

Title = {Using self and peer video annotations of simulated patient encounters in
   communication training to facilitate the reflection of communication
   skills: an implementation study},
Journal = {GMS JOURNAL FOR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {38},
Number = {3},
Abstract = {Background: The mandatory communication skills course for fourth-year
   medical students at the University of Bern Medical School aims to
   prepare students for challenging communication situations. Students
   role-play four different scenarios with simulated patients (SPs) and
   receive feedback from the patient's perspective. The scenarios are
   video-recorded and uploaded onto the University's virtual learning
   environment. Students can watch and annotate their own videos and give
   others access to view them.
   Project description: Although the course is well liked by students, we
   identified three areas for improvement:
   lack of faculty feedback;
   little active use of the video-recordings;
   lack of opportunity for students to discuss their experiences with each
   other.
   We aimed to address these shortcomings by introducing an additional
   learning task: students are asked to annotate a section of the video in
   which they had performed well, and one in which they thought they could
   have done better, in both their own and a colleague's videos. These
   video clips and annotations served as the basis of a subsequent two-hour
   small-group seminar with a physician tutor. The course was evaluated by
   a mandatory online questionnaire.
   Results: All 247 students completed the questionnaire. The annotation
   tool and task were deemed to be comprehensible. Students believed they
   had learnt more from annotating a peers' video than from their own and
   most thought being assessed by peers was acceptable. The physician
   tutors' comments were largely deemed as helpful. The mean mark for the
   course given by students was 4.6 (median 5) (1=very poor, 6=very good).
   Conclusion: A communication skills course expanded by video-annotations
   and group discussions with a physician tutor was shown to be feasible
   and was well received by students and faculty.},

Abstract = {Image and video-based results and process control are essential tools of
   a new teaching concept for conveying surgical skills. The new teaching
   concept integrates approved teaching principles and new media.
   Every performance of exercises is videotaped and the result
   photographically recorded. The quality of the process and result becomes
   accessible for an analysis by the teacher and the student/learner. The
   learner is instructed to perform a criteria-based self-analysis of the
   video and image material by themselves.
   The new learning concept has so far been successfully applied in seven
   rounds within the newly designed modular class ``Intensivkurs
   Chirurgische Techniken{''} (Intensive training of surgical techniques).
   Result documentation and analysis via digital picture was completed by
   almost every student. The quality of the results was high. Interestingly
   the result quality did not correlate with the time needed for the
   exercise. The training success had a lasting effect.
   The new and elaborate concept improves the quality of teaching. In the
   long run resources for patient care should be saved when training
   students according to this concept prior to performing tasks in the
   operating theater. These resources should be allocated for further
   refining innovative teaching concepts.},

Abstract = {Background Hysterectomy rates are decreasing in many countries, and
   virtual reality (VR) simulators bring new training opportunities for
   residents. As coaching interventions while training on a simulated
   complex procedure represents a resource challenge, alternative
   strategies to improve surgical skills must be investigated. We sought to
   determine whether self-guided learning using a video-based
   self-assessment (SA) leads to improved surgical skills in laparoscopic
   hysterectomy (LH) on a VR simulator. Methods Twenty-four gynecology
   residents from two university hospitals were randomized into an SA group
   (n = 12) and a Control group (n = 12). Each participant's baseline
   performance on a validated VR basic task was assessed. Both groups then
   performed three virtually simulated LHs during which the participants
   received no guidance nor feedback. Following each LH, the SA group
   participants rated the video of their own performance using a generic
   and a procedure-specific rating scale, while the Control group
   participants watched an LH video demonstration. The LH videos of both
   groups' participants were blindly reviewed and rated by expert surgeons,
   using modified Objective Structured Assessment of Technical Skills
   scores (OSATS). Objective metrics recorded by the VR simulator were also
   compared. Results There was no difference between the groups' baseline
   performances on the VR basic task. For the first LH, the OSATS-derived
   scores did not differ between SA and Control groups (9 {[}7-13] versus 9
   {[}8-14]; p = 0.728). For the third LH, the OSATS-derived scores were
   higher for the SA group than for the Control group (17 {[}15-21] versus
   15 {[}11-17], p = 0.039). Between the two groups, the objective metrics
   did not differ from the first to the third LH. Conclusions The use of a
   structured video-based SA leads to improved procedural skills in LH on a
   VR simulator compared to watching benchmark expert performance, in a

Abstract = {Technology is getting popular in mathematics learning while the new
   learning method often involves innovative design. By taking flipped
   classroom and game-based learning as a reference, we designed a
   Technology Self-Directed Learning (TSDL) package, consisting of notes
   with QR codes, online Google Classroom platform and game-based
   activities, which aims to consolidate students' knowledge through a set
   of five-step Self-Directed Learning Indicators (Goal Setting,
   Self-Planning, Self-Monitoring, Self-Evaluation and Revision). How may
   students accept and learn from the TSDL pedagogical approach? This paper
   aims to explore students' participation and acceptance of self-directed
   learning with technology on mathematics.
   The innovative design consists of mathematics notes with QR codes to
   provide an extra channel for students to understand the concepts and how
   to complete the teaching examples before seeking help from others. To
   achieve the above, students can access teaching videos by scanning the
   QR codes. The practice of using flipped classroom encourages students to
   equip basic knowledge and skills outside the classroom as well as more
   advanced activity or discussion in an environment with an extended
   virtual space of learning. Besides, all the teaching materials and past
   papers could be retrieved and downloaded from their class's Google
   Classroom. This online platform provides students with an opportunity to
   learn and revise at their own pace. Last but not least is the game-based
   activities, which consists of daily-life problems, hands-on activities,
   online activities (e.g. Geogebra) and Kahoot! quizzes. These game-based
   learning activities not only further develop students' concepts and
   skills; but also nurture their positive and proactive learning attitude
   towards mathematics.
   The students' levels of self-direction in learning were measured by
   using Self-Rating Scale of Self-Directed Learning (SRSSDL) while the
   students' participation and acceptance of this mode of learning were
   investigated by using Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with a number of
   measures, including students' perceived usefulness, perceived ease of
   use, the frequency of current usage and expected future usage of this
   package. The data collection includes questionnaire survey, interviews
   and students' work.
   The results of the questionnaire show that more than half of the
   students found the package useful and easy to use, while more than 50\%
   of them are currently using this package several times a week and about
   50\% would likely be using it in the future. Furthermore, students'
   positive perception can be found in the interview data as all of them
   believe Kahoot! quizzes are interesting. Among the three components, the
   online platform and game-based activities are more popular than the
   notes with QR codes. Further research is needed to investigate any
   game-related pedagogical approach, which promotes self-directed learning
   with online course material.},

Title = {The influence of sociodemographic factors on students' attitudes toward

Abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) technologies
   offer the potential to support digital content creation and media
   production, providing opportunities for individuals from diverse
   sociodemographic backgrounds to engage in creative activities and
   enhance their multimedia video content. However, less attention has been
   paid to recent research exploring any possible relationships between
   AI-generated video creation and the sociodemographic variables of
   undergraduate students. This study aims to investigate the multifaceted
   relationship between AI-generated video content and sociodemographics by
   examining its implications for inclusivity, equity, and representation
   in the digital media landscape. An empirical study about the use of AI
   in video content creation was conducted with a diverse cohort of three
   hundred ninety-eighth undergraduate (n = 398) students. Participants
   voluntarily took part and were tasked with conceiving and crafting their
   AI-generated video content. All instruments used were combined into a
   single web-based self-report questionnaire that was delivered to all
   participants via email. Key research findings demonstrate that students
   have a favorable disposition when it comes to incorporating AI-supported
   learning tasks. The factors fostering this favorable attitude among
   students include their age, the number of devices they use, the time
   they dedicate to utilizing technological resources, and their level of
   experience. Nevertheless, it is the student's participation in AI
   training courses that exerts a direct impact on students' ML attitudes,
   along with their level of contentment with the reliability of these
   technologies. This study contributes to a more comprehensive
   understanding of the transformative power of AI in video content
   creation and underscores the importance of considering instructional
   contexts and policies to ensure a fair and equitable digital media
   platform for students from diverse sociodemographic backgrounds.},

Abstract = {Designing a cost-effective, scalable, and flexible architecture that
   supports low latency and high quality live video streaming is still a
   challenge for Over-The-Top (OTT) service providers. To cope with this
   issue, this paper leverages Peer-to-Peer (P2P), Content Delivery Network
   (CDN), edge computing, Network Function Virtualization (NFV), and
   distributed video transcoding paradigms to introduce a hybRId P2P-CDN
   arcHiTecture for livE video stReaming (RICHTER). We first introduce
   RICHTER's multi-layer architecture and design an action tree that
   considers all feasible resources provided by peers, edge, and CDN
   servers for serving peer requests with minimum latency and maximum
   quality. We then formulate the problem as an optimization model executed
   at the edge of the network. We present an Online Learning (OL) approach
   that leverages an unsupervised Self Organizing Map (SOM) to (i)
   alleviate the time complexity issue of the optimization model and (ii)
   make it a suitable solution for large-scale scenarios, by enabling
   decisions for groups of requests instead of for single requests.
   Finally, we implement the RICHTER framework, conduct our experiments on
   a large-scale cloud-based testbed including 350 HAS players, and compare
   its effectiveness with baseline systems. The experimental results
   illustrate that RICHTER outperforms baseline schemes in terms of users'
   Quality of Experience (QoE), latency, and network utilization, by at
   least 59\%, 39\%, and 70\% respectively.},

Abstract = {Background: Educational videos have become valuable resources and can
   address some of the pitfalls of traditional learning. To ensure
   clerkship students have adequate exposure to curriculum objectives, a
   series of objective-aligned self-directed learning video podcasts
   covering core surgical concepts were developed by medical students and
   surgical residents. The objective of the study was to evaluate the
   efficacy of the video podcasts in the surgery clerkship rotation.
   Methods: Nineteen video podcasts were created, housed at , and
   distributed to third-year medical students completing their surgical
   clerkship. A 10-question multiple-choice quiz was administered before
   and after students viewed each video, and they were also asked to
   complete a satisfaction survey.
   Results: A total of 302 paired pretests and posttests were completed.
   There was a mean increase of 2.7 points in posttest scores compared with
   pretest scores (p < 0.001). On a Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 5 being
   excellent, students rated the usefulness of the videos as 4.3, the
   quality of the content as 4.3 and the quality of the video as 4.2.
   Ninety-eight percent of students would recommend these videos to their
   classmates.
   Conclusion: Video podcasts are an effective modality for engaging
   medical students and may improve standardization of learning during
   their surgical clerkship.},

Abstract = {Over the last decades, videotaping has been widely accepted to be a
   useful tool for teachers' professional development-(PD) ({[}1], {[}2]).
   Compared with analyzing other teachers' videos, teachers who analyzed
   their own teaching experienced higher activation, manifested by higher
   immersion, resonance, and motivation. In addition, they became more
   aware of relevant components of teaching and learning ({[}3]). In this
   study, we adopted Mason's framework (1998) ({[}4]), for such levels,
   developed for mathematics teachers. This led us to develop a program The
   Video-Based Didactic discourse-(VBD discourse) whose aim is to provide
   mathematics and physics teachers with professional development. The
   mathematics education researchers' community has become interested in
   characterizing the required knowledge for mathematics teaching. Relying
   on Shulman's (1986) work, {[}5] defined the term ``Mathematical
   Knowledge for Teaching{''}(MKT) as knowledge that crosses areas and
   levels of school mathematics, supports connected ideas, and emphasizes
   the ability to plan, integrate and manage appropriate mathematical
   content for teaching. Following this work, {[}6], presented six
   different components of MKT. Two of them are particularly relevant to
   this study: Specialized Content Knowledge-(SCK) and Knowledge of Content
   and Students-(KCS). The purpose of our research was to examine how the
   VBD discourse contributes to the development of five pre-service
   teachers' MKT, during their participation in a Didactics of mathematics
   course at the Academic College of Education. An analysis of the findings
   indicates that the VBD discourse based on their video mathematics
   teaching raised their awareness, and contributed to the development of
   their SCK and KCS.},

   Education e -Learning Program (ScMHEeLP); and (c) pilot whether ScMHEeLP
   can improve knowledge, self -care management, and glycemic controls of
   T2DM patients.
   Method: This pilot study uses a multiphase mixed -methods design.
   Twenty-three participants were involved in in-depth interviews as the
   basis for developing ScMHEeLP, and thirty-seven voluntary participants
   were recruited for the evaluation phase. The ScMHEeLP was piloted for 3
   months to test its effectiveness in improving the knowledge, self -care
   management, and glycemic controls of T2DM patients. Thematic analysis
   was used to examine the qualitative data, and the Wilcoxon test was used
   for quantitative data.
   Results: In the development phase revealed patients' and healthcare
   providers' concerns, issues, and challenges regarding diabetic care,
   especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Based on these findings, the
   ScMHEeLP was developed in the form of web -based. ScMHEeLP consists of
   seven animatic videos, completed with a feature to evaluate patients'
   understanding of the disease and treatments. ScMHEeLP was downloadable
   and accessible anywhere and anytime (online-offline). In the evaluation
   phase showed a significant difference in the levels of knowledge (Z=
   -5.306, p = 0.000), levels of self -care activities (Z=-5.1]9. p=
   0.000), and level of fasting blood sugar (Z= -4.282, p= 0.000), before
   and after the implementation of ScMHEeLP.
   Conclusions: ScMHEeLP was able to improve knowledge and self -care
   activities and able to lower fasting blood sugar levels. ScMHEeLP still
   needs continuous improvement and further testing for better outcome.

Abstract = {In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, the issue of self-paced flipped
   learning has received considerably critical attention, because the
   physical face-to-face classroom has become one of the major obstacles
   during the pandemic. This research aims to figure out the effects of
   self-paced flipped learning on students' learning efficiency,
   satisfaction, and achievements. By collecting and analyzing data from
   the web of science core collection, the authors concluded that the
   self-paced flipped learning assisted with technology was conducive to
   students' learning engagement, satisfaction, and outcomes; as well as
   their self-regulation skills, effort-invested capacity, and monitoring
   ability. Challenges exist for both teachers and students as this
   learning model demands higher investments from both sides. Future
   empirical research, which takes these variables into account, will need
   to be undertaken.},

Abstract = {This research article aims to add to current knowledge on reflection,
   body-worn video, and police education. It examines the potential effects
   of an intervention which employed subcams (a type of body-worn video)
   and replay interviews of video footage to enhance experiential learning
   during an operative training course for Norwegian police students in
   their final year of study. Our investigation examines evaluation surveys
   for differences between an intervention and comparison group on
   reflection and experiential learning outcomes. Findings indicate that
   students in the intervention group self-reported more general learning
   outcomes from the course concerning decision-making and communication
   and that they could identify their own mistakes to a greater degree.
   They also reported more learning outcomes as measured by the number of
   statements written about what they learned and would change to improve
   their performance on three different simulations. Moreover, the content
   of these statements reflected the intervention as they involved
   communication and decision-making to a greater degree than students in
   the comparison group. Implications for the further use of body-worn
   video to encourage reflection and enhance experiential learning in
   professional police training and development are discussed.},

Abstract = {Video in the classroom is used for educational purposes all over the
   world, but other studies are based on the use of video recording for
   preparing examination or to supply the traditional class. In the present
   work, based on a training innovation project of the University of Cadiz,
   entitled ``Development of audio-visual resources by the student for the
   subject of specific methods of intervention in physiotherapy III{''},
   the students recorded videos in practical class with an expert help.
   After the edition process, the videos were published on YouTube and the
   institutional virtual campus.
   These videos were reviewed and allowed the detection of mistakes and
   successes in the practical process, allowing student and teacher guide
   the learning process correcting errors and strengthening the successes.
   Also, they were used by the students for preparing the final practical
   examination.
   A total of 47 students took part in this project in 2017 and 47 students
   will participate in 2018. The expert in audio-visual resources informed
   about the professionalism of the students during the video recording,
   and about some fails. A total of 34 techniques were recorded twice by
   two different students groups.
   In order to obtain the student satisfaction, two surveys to evaluate the
   student impressions was performed. Initial survey (before the video
   record) and a final survey (in subject final exams) were filled by the
   students to evaluate the different impressions about the project. The
   results in all questions of both surveys show a broad consensus among
   the students surveyed since in all questions obtains more of 70\% of
   agree. In particular the questions ``Do you consider the video resources
   could help in the learning process?{''} The 100\% of students in both
   surveys suggested they are in agreement with the statement. And about
   the question ``Does the process of video recording upgrade my
   self-worth?{''}, the 70,2\% of students agreed.
   In conclusion, video recording is a useful tool to support the study of
   the practical content of physiotherapy. This process generated a big
   video database, which can be used for the teacher in future courses, and
   can help to student to prepare the final practical exams and definitely
   to be a better future professional.},

Title = {The effects of a self-developed virtual reality environment on college
   EFL learners' vocabulary learning},
Journal = {INTERACTIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENTS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 APR 24},
Abstract = {In second language acquisition (SLA), vocabulary learning can be a great
   challenge for some English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. Virtual
   Reality (VR) technology has unleashed its potential in language
   education, but insufficient attention has yet been paid to its impact on
   EFL learners' vocabulary learning. To bridge this gap, we conducted a
   quasi-experiment based on a self-developed VR platform, in order to
   investigate the effects of VR on EFL learners' vocabulary learning. A
   total of 68 college students participated in this study and were
   assigned to either the experimental (VR players) or the comparison
   (video watchers) group. The results revealed that the VR players
   significantly outperformed the video watchers in terms of vocabulary
   learning. The VR environment contextualized vocabulary learning by
   providing an authentic language learning experience, a strong sense of
   presence, and instant interaction and feedback, whereas the VR players'
   learning motivation still needed to be strengthened. Analysis of
   semi-structured interviews further demonstrated that most of the
   students valued the potential of the VR-assisted learning approach,
   while some of them still held mixed feelings about it. This study
   provides some suggestions for both language instructors and technical
   experts in terms of task design, platform optimization, and material
   development.},

   from four undergraduate classes, were randomly assigned to one of two
   video conditions based on whether the instructor had a continuous or
   intermittent presence in an instructional video teaching procedural
   knowledge. A series of independent sample t tests revealed that a

   the 2nd Experimental Lyceum School of Thessaloniki, Greece in the
   context of the optional course ``Multimedia-Networks{''}. For the
   implementation of the proposed educational intervention LAMS was used
   via the server of the Educational Content, Methodology and Technology
   Laboratory of the Hellenic Open University. LAMS is a ``Learning
   Design{''} system which focuses on sequences of collaborative learning
   activities and participants (students and teachers) access an activity
   sequence with a different role (Learner and Author/Monitor). The
   suggested educational scenario focuses on educating students
   face-to-face (f2f) or from a distance, individually or in groups and
   collaboratively and with their own pace of study. The main aim of the
   activities sequence is to lead students to co-operate via LAMS and use
   Windows Movie Maker. Moreover, it aims to improve students' creativity,
   reflective thinking, ability to compare their own experience with
   conclusions of a research work on digital natives' changes and
   presentation skills. The implementation of the proposed blended learning
   intervention via LAMS showed that teachers and students are supported.
   Teachers can design their course and re-use their digital
   lessons/sequences; they can complement their teaching with web-based
   tools and support their students' learning from distance. Also, they
   facilitate themselves with new tools for assessment and tracking
   students' progress and they can prepare their lessons in a way that
   promotes interactivity, collaboration, group-working and self-controlled
   studying. Students collaborate in groups in the LAMS environment and use
   the basic tools of Windows Movie Maker environment in order to
   synthesize their own movie. With that movie, they express the results of
   their reflective discussion about the changes of digital natives
   according to their experience and the conclusions of a published
   research paper. Moreover, students have the opportunity to familiarize
   themselves with LAMS, with distance and self-learning, with
   self-assessment and writing a text using language properly, with
   synchronous and asynchronous discussion, with uploading and submitting
   files to Web, taking into consideration their own safety. After the
   completion of the educational scenario the students are prepared to
   collaborate in future educational scenarios with more complicated Movie
   Maker application and generally with environments that use multimedia
   elements, like editing of video, combination of sounds, images and
   video. Also, they are introduced to critical discussion and they can
   express their conclusions after comparing their experiences with
   conclusions of a published research (written in different than their
   mother tongue). Additionally to all the above, the blended learning mode
   promote students to learn how they can learn, to organize their time
   according to their assessments and activities, to act collaboratively.},

Title = {Computer-based video training is effective in teaching basic surgical

Abstract = {Introduction: Computer-based video training (CBVT) of surgical skills
   overcomes limitations of 1:1 instruction. We hypothesized that a
   self-directed CBVT program could teach novices by dividing basic
   surgical skills into sequential, easily-mastered steps.
   Methods: We developed a 12 video program teaching basic knot tying and
   suturing skills introduced in discrete, incremental steps. Students were
   evaluated pre- and post-course with a self-assessment, a written exam
   and a skill assessment.
   Results: Students (n = 221) who completed the course demonstrated
   significant improvement. Their average pre-course product quality score
   and assessment of technique using standard Global Rating Scale (GRS)
   were <0.4 for 6 measured skills (scale 0-5) and increased post-course to
   >= 3.25 except for the skill tying on tension whose GRS = 2.51. Average
   speed increased for all skills. Students' self-ratings (scale 1-5)
   increased from an average of 1.4 +/- 0.7 pre-elective to 3.9 +/- 0.9
   post-elective across all skills (P < 0.01).
   Conclusion: Self-directed, incremental and sequential video training is
   effective teaching basic surgical skills and may be a model to teach
   other skills or to play a larger role in remote learning. (C) 2020

Title = {A self-supervised spatio-temporal attention network for video-based 3D
   infant pose estimation},
Journal = {MEDICAL IMAGE ANALYSIS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {96},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {General movement and pose assessment of infants is crucial for the early
   detection of cerebral palsy (CP). Nevertheless, most human pose
   estimation methods, in 2D or 3D, focus on adults due to the lack of
   large datasets and pose annotations on infants. To solve these problems,
   here we present a model known as YOLOinfantPose, which has been
   fine-tuned, for infant pose estimation in 2D. We further propose a
   self-supervised model called STAPose3D for 3D infant pose estimation
   based on videos. We employ multi-view video data during the training
   process as a strategy to address the challenge posed by the absence of
   3D pose annotations. STAPose3D combines temporal convolution, temporal
   attention, and graph attention to jointly learn spatiotemporal features
   of infant pose. Our methods are summarized into two stages: applying
   YOLO-infantPose on input videos, followed by lifting these 2D poses
   along with respective confidences for every joint to 3D. The employment
   of the best-performing 2D detector in the first stage significantly
   improves the precision of 3D pose estimation. We reveal that fine-tuned
   YOLO-infantPose outperforms other models tested on our clinical dataset
   as well as two public datasets MINI-RGBD and YouTube-Infant dataset.
   Results from our infant movement video dataset demonstrate that
   STAPose3D effectively comprehends the spatio-temporal features among
   different views and significantly improves the performance of 3D infant
   pose estimation in videos. Finally, we explore the clinical application
   of our method for general movement assessment (GMA) in a clinical
   dataset annotated as normal writhing movements or abnormal monotonic
   movements according to the GMA standards. We show that the 3D pose
   estimation results produced by our STAPose3D model significantly boost
   the GMA prediction performance than 2D pose estimation. Our code is
   available at github.com/wwYinYin/STAPose3D.},

   rehabilitation of individuals with spinal cord injury},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SPINAL CORD MEDICINE},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {42},

Pages = {338-346},
Abstract = {Objective: Evaluate effects of revised education classes on classroom
   engagement during inpatient rehabilitation for individuals with spinal
   cord injury/disease (SCI/D).
   Design: Multiple-baseline, quasi-experimental design with video recorded
   engagement observations during conventional and revised education
   classes; visual and statistical analysis of difference in positive
   engagement responses observed in classes using each approach.
   Participants/Setting: 81 patients (72\% male, 73\% white, mean age 36 SD
   15.6) admitted for SCI/D inpatient rehabilitation in a non-profit
   rehabilitation hospital, who attended one or more of 33 care
   self-management education classes that were video recorded. All study
   activities were approved by the host facility institutional review
   board.
   Intervention: Conventional nurse-led self-management classes were
   replaced with revised peer-led classes incorporating approaches to
   promote transformative learning. Revised classes were introduced across
   three subject areas in a step-wise fashion over 15 weeks.
   Outcome Measure: Positive engagement responses (asking questions,
   participating in discussion, gesturing, raising hand, or otherwise
   noting approval) were documented from video recordings of 14
   conventional and 19 revised education classes.
   Results: Significantly higher average (per patient per class) positive
   engagement responses were observed in the revised compared to
   conventional classes (p =0.008).
   Conclusion: Redesigning SCI inpatient rehabilitation care
   self-management classes to promote transformative learning increased
   patient engagement. Additional research is needed to examine longer term
   outcomes and replicability in other settings.},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Japanese-as-a-foreign language (JFL) education, the impacts of
   Japanese entertainment media such digital games have been noted as a
   motivator for JFL learners. Although outside-of-class literacy exposure
   from these digital games has been recognized due to their popularity,
   the specifics of how digital games affect JFL digital literacies and how
   they interplay with JFL learners' motivations have not yet been fully
   explored. Thus, this study investigated the literacies around game
   fandoms for JFL learners in a Japanese language program (n = 191) and
   the self-directed and group-based learning activities of a game focus
   group (n = 6) with two commercial games. The findings demonstrated JFL
   learners' literacy exposure through Japanese games and revealed JFL
   learners' unique issues with kanji, furigana, and honorifics.
   Additionally, digital games in Japanese have roles in supporting JFL
   learners' motivations (a) visually achievement milestones (i.e.,
   progress markers) within game content and (b) as goals that JFL learners
   for accessing and playing target game titles both as gamers and as JFL
   learners. Moreover, the study highlights the importance for higher
   education to connect in-class and non-formal learning and to support L2
   learners with 21st century skills.},

Title = {Using a 360° Virtual Reality or 2D Video to Learn History Taking and
   Physical Examination Skills for Undergraduate Medical Students: Pilot
   Randomized Controlled Trial},
Journal = {JMIR SERIOUS GAMES},

Abstract = {Background: Learning through a 360 degrees virtual reality (VR) or 2D
   video represents an alternative way to learn a complex medical education
   task. However, there is currently no consensus on how best to assess the
   effects of different learning materials on cognitive load estimates,
   heart rate variability (HRV), outcomes, and experience in learning
   history taking and physical examination (H\&P) skills.
   Objective: The aim of this study was to investigate how learning
   materials (ie, VR or 2D video) impact learning outcomes and experience
   through changes in cognitive load estimates and HRV for learning H\&P
   skills.
   Methods: This pilot system-design study included 32 undergraduate
   medical students at an academic teaching hospital. The students were
   randomly assigned, with a 1:1 allocation, to a 360 degrees VR video
   group or a 2D video group, matched by age, sex, and cognitive style. The
   contents of both videos were different with regard to visual angle and
   self-determination. Learning outcomes were evaluated using the Milestone
   reporting form. Subjective and objective cognitive loads were estimated
   using the Paas Cognitive Load Scale, the National Aeronautics and Space
   Administration Task Load Index, and secondary-task reaction time.
   Cardiac autonomic function was assessed using HRV measurements. Learning
   experience was assessed using the AttrakDiff2 questionnaire and
   qualitative feedback. Statistical significance was accepted at a
   two-sided P value of <.01.
   Results: All 32 participants received the intended intervention. The
   sample consisted of 20 (63\%) males and 12 (38\%) females, with a median
   age of 24 (IQR 23-25) years. The 360 degrees VR video group seemed to
   have a higher Milestone level than the 2D video group (P=.04). The
   reaction time at the 10th minute in the 360 degrees VR video group was
   significantly higher than that in the 2D video group (P<.001). Multiple
   logistic regression models of the overall cohort showed that the 360
   degrees VR video module was independently and positively associated with
   a reaction time at the 10th minute of >= 3.6 seconds (exp B=18.8, 95\%
   CI 3.2-110.8; P=.001) and a Milestone level of >= 3 (exp B=15.0, 95\% CI
   2.3-99.6; P=.005). However, a reaction time at the 10th minute of >= 3.6
   seconds was not related to a Milestone level of >= 3. A low-frequency to
   high-frequency ratio between the 5th and 10th minute of >= 1.43 seemed
   to be inversely associated with a hedonic stimulation score of >= 2.0
   (exp B=0.14, 95\% CI 0.03-0.68; P=.015) after adjusting for video
   module. The main qualitative feedback indicated that the 360 degrees VR
   video module was fun but caused mild dizziness, whereas the 2D video
   module was easy to follow but tedious.
   Conclusions: Our preliminary results showed that 360 degrees VR video
   learning may be associated with a better Milestone level than 2D video
   learning, and that this did not seem to be related to cognitive load
   estimates or HRV indexes in the novice learners. Of note, an increase in
   sympathovagal balance may have been associated with a lower hedonic
   stimulation score, which may have met the learners' needs and prompted
   learning through the different video modules.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {36},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {This meta-analysis explores the impact of positive instructors on
   learning from instructional videos. Both the contagion theory and the
   cognitive-affective theory of learning with media suggest that positive
   instructors can facilitate learning. This review analyzed 37 studies
   reporting various outcomes, including positive emotion, motivation,
   attention, cognitive load, learning experience, learning satisfaction,
   self-efficacy, and learning achievement. The overall findings revealed
   that positive instructors in instructional videos significantly enhanced
   learners' positive emotion, motivation, learning experience, learning
   satisfaction, and learning achievement, and encouraged student attention
   to the instructor. However, no significant effect was found regarding
   attention paid to visual materials, cognitive load, and self-efficacy. A
   series of moderating effect analyses were also conducted. The results
   indicated that the impact of positive instructors is influenced by
   instructor characteristics and emotional expressions, as well as other
   factors independent of the instructors. These findings provide
   systematic evidence and practical insights for the design of effective
   instructional videos.},

Abstract = {This paper described an effort and resource required to generate and
   deploy Thai-language instructional video clips for pre-class material
   delivery as a part of the flipped classroom implementation for a
   fundamental engineering course. Works, from adapting slides and
   recording video clips, were shared between two participating lecturers
   on personally-owned devices. It was found that the time required to
   generate the video clips were at least 3 times the resulting clip
   lengths. While the equipment, and operational cost could be kept down,
   investment in a good video editing software was necessary. The most
   important factor for success was the determination to push through the
   entire course despite the workload. Gained lessons included not being
   too ambitious or aiming for perfection; acceptable quality videos were
   enough. For clip deployment, the communication with students was also
   needed. The initial worry about students' accessibility to video clips
   and online platforms was not found to be of much concern. However, the
   learning mobility of students was hampered by the internet connection
   speed and the need for a suitable self-studying environment; the most
   preferred location and time were at home in the evenings.},

   We demonstrate CThru with an animation clip in cellular biology,
   supplementing visible objects in the video with rich domain-specific
   multimedia information and interactive 3D models. We describe CThru's
   design rationale and implementation. We also discuss a pilot study and
   what it revealed with respect to CThru's interface and the usage pattern

Title = {Learning analytics and the Universal Design for Learning (UDL): A
   clustering approach},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {214},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In the context of inclusive education, Universal Design for Learning
   (UDL) is a framework used worldwide to create learning opportunities
   accessible to all learners. While much research focused on the design
   and students' perceptions of UDL-based learning settings, studies on
   students' usage patterns in UDL-guided elements, particularly in digital
   environments, are still scarce. Therefore, we analyze and cluster the
   usage patterns of 9th and 10th graders in a webbased learning platform
   called I3Learn. The platform focuses on chemistry learning, and UDL
   principles guide its design. We collected the temporal usage patterns of
   UDL-guided elements of 384 learners in detailed log files. The collected
   data includes the time spent using video and/or text as a source of
   information, working on learning tasks with or without help and working
   on self-assessments. We used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to
   identify relevant factors in the observed usage behaviors. Based on the
   factor loadings, we extracted features for k-means clustering and named
   the resulting groups based on their usage patterns and learner
   characteristics. The EFA revealed four factors suggesting that learners
   remain consistent in selecting UDL-guided elements that require a
   decision (video or text, tasks with or without help). Based on these
   four factors, the cluster analysis identifies six different groups. We
   discuss these results as a starting point to provide individualized
   learning support through further artificial intelligence applications
   and inform educators about learner activity through a dashboard.},

Abstract = {In this paper, a video streaming system for education based on a
   wireless mesh network is proposed. A wireless mesh network is a
   self-organizing, self-managing and reliable intelligent network, which
   allows educators to deploy a network quickly. Video streaming plays an
   important role in this system for multimedia data transmission. This new
   system adopts the scalable video coding scheme that enables the video
   server to deliver layered videos to different user groups. In addition,
   a quality control method was developed to automatically change the
   output data rate based on network conditions. Real implementation test

Abstract = {Background Breast self-examination is a convenient and effective way to
   detect breast abnormalities. Based on Dale's Cone of Experience theory,
   we hypothesized that the combination of a smartphone application with
   hands-on practice would have a greater impact than using a smartphone
   application alone. The purpose of this study was to compare the effects
   of different educational methods on (a) knowledge, (b) attitudes, (c)
   skills, and (d) students' satisfaction with the learning methods.
   Methods We conducted a pre- and post-test quasi-experimental design and
   developed a smartphone application using a video clip. One experimental
   group received smartphone-based education, another group received
   smartphone-based education combined with hands-on practice, and the
   control group received a one-time classroom lecture. We administered a
   pre-test, provided intervention, and conducted a post-test. Results
   Among the three groups, the knowledge and attitude of the experimental
   groups were significantly higher than that of the control group. In
   addition, the group using the combination of the smartphone application
   and hands-on practice showed the highest score changes in skills and
   satisfaction with the learning methods. Conclusions Smartphone
   application use combined with hands-on practice could be an effective
   education method for breast self-examination.},

Month = {JUL 6},
Abstract = {Background: Video is used daily for various purposes, such as leisure,
   culture, and even learning. Currently, video is a tool that is available
   to a large part of the population and is simple to use. This
   audio-visual format has many advantages such as its low cost, speed of
   dissemination, and possible interaction between users. For these
   reasons, it is a tool with high dissemination and educational potential,
   which could be used in the field of health for learning about and
   management of chronic diseases by adult patients.
   Objective: The following review determines whether the use of health
   educational videos by adult patients with chronic diseases is effective
   for their self-management according to the literature.
   Methods: An electronic literature search of the PubMed, CINAHL, and
   MEDLINE (via the EBSCOhost platform) databases up to April 2020 was
   conducted. The systematic scoping review followed the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA)
   methodology.
   Results: After reviewing 1427 articles, 12 were selected as the most
   consistent with the proposed inclusion criteria. After their review, it
   was found that the studies showed that video is effective as a tool for
   improving care related to chronic diseases.
   Conclusions: Video is effective in improving the care and quality of
   life for patients with chronic diseases, whether the initiative for
   using video came from their health care professionals or themselves.},

Title = {Dynamic Difference Learning With Spatio-Temporal Correlation for
   Deepfake Video Detection},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON INFORMATION FORENSICS AND SECURITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Pages = {4046-4058},
Abstract = {With the rapid development of face forgery techniques, the existing
   frame-based deepfake video detection methods have fell into a dilemma
   that frame-based methods may fail when encountering extremely realistic
   images. To overcome the above problem, many approaches attempted to
   model the spatio-temporal inconsistency of videos to distinguish real
   and fake videos. However, current works model spatio-temporal
   inconsistency by combining intra-frame and inter-frame information, but
   ignore the disturbance caused by facial motions that would limit further
   improvement in detection performance. To address this issue, we
   investigate into long and short range inter-frame motions and propose a
   novel dynamic difference learning method to distinguish between the
   inter-frame differences caused by face manipulation and the inter-frame
   differences caused by facial motions in order to model precise
   spatio-temporal inconsistency for deepfake video detection. Moreover, we
   elaborately design a dynamic fine-grained difference capture module
   (DFDC-module) and a multi-scale spatio-temporal aggregation module
   (MSA-module) to collaboratively model spatio-temporal inconsistency.
   Specifically, the DFDC-module applies self-attention mechanism and
   fine-grained denoising operation to eliminate the differences caused by
   facial motions and generates long range difference attention maps. The
   MSA-module is devised to aggregate multi-direction and multi-scale
   temporal information to model spatio-temporal inconsistency. The
   existing 2D CNNs can be extended into dynamic spatio-temporal
   inconsistency capture networks by integrating the proposed two modules.
   Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm
   steadily outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a clear margin in
   different benchmark datasets.},

Abstract = {This paper suggests efficient learning improvement method of computer
   use instruction based on flipped learning. Traditional computer use
   classes were difficult to practice and collaborative with sufficient
   lectures. However, we used KOCW (Korea Open Courseware) as a footstep
   video in the class using the flipped learning method and learned in
   advance before entering the classroom. In the classroom, we conducted
   collaborative hands on class based on mutual discussion. After the
   instruction, we measured learning motivation and satisfaction by grade,
   and major using the motivation test tool. The results showed that degree
   of attention awareness, perception of class relevance and perception of
   learning satisfaction were analyzed as Very satisfied' and `satisfied'
   more than 90\%. The flip-learning-based instructional model proposed in
   this paper is composed of `Before class', `In class', and `After class'.
   Because students participate in classes by watching class-related videos
   beforehand in class, students should concentrate on hands-on lessons
   during class and spend lots of time in practical exercises due to the
   nature of computer use classes. This study was conducted for college
   students. The learning motivation test tool used in this study was
   developed by Lee(2015). The questionnaires were composed of 20 items, 5
   items of attention, 4 items of relatedness, 5 items of self-confidence,
   and 6 items of satisfaction. As a result, the degree of attention of
   students of natural science majors was rated as 4.4 points and the
   learning satisfaction as 4.1 points. It was found out that students were
   pre-studying the footstep video using KOCW and were actively involved in
   learning by curiosity about learning contents. In addition, students
   with diverse backgrounds conducted collaborative discussion-based
   instruction, which enabled active lectures led by learners, which
   enabled students to solve the questions they had in the lecture room.},

   examine the educational affordances of music-related games through
   content analysis. User reviews of music gaming mobile apps and video
   games were collected from two major digital distribution platforms and
   analysed to identify patterns and meanings related to their educational
   affordances and learning design. The findings reflected a sense of
   competence, autonomy and engagement resulting from playing video games,
   which motivated players to become self-directed learners in the context
   of informal learning. Several bias and limitations were identified,
   suggesting that an overreliance on video games may lead to unbalanced
   musical growth and incomprehensive musicianship training.},

Abstract = {This article reports on a collaborative self-study conducted by the
   authors (two teacher educators) as we attempted to implement a pedagogy
   of care during the disruptions to teacher education caused by COVID-19.
   Due to the pandemic, we were required to conduct our teacher education
   courses synchronously online through video-conferencing software.
   Although this mode of instruction allowed us to continue teaching
   despite the restrictions necessitated by COVID-19, the relational aspect
   of teaching and the role of care seemed to be limited and became an
   important concern for us. Through self-study, we aimed to improve our
   online teaching practices by enacting a pedagogy of care during one full
   semester. We detail our attempts to conceptualise a pedagogy of care for
   the online classroom, begin our courses from a position of care and
   prioritize and maintain care throughout the semester. We also present
   the ongoing challenges we experienced in implementing a pedagogy of care
   online. While recognising that everyone has been affected by COVID-19 in
   different ways, we hope through sharing our experiences, others can
   learn from them and conceptualise and implement a pedagogy of care in
   their contexts.},

Abstract = {The development of teaching in the European Higher Education Area (EHEA)
   must come necessarily accompanied by changes in educational strategies,
   in which information technologies (ICT) play an important role. These
   have allowed the reorienting teacher's pedagogical practice towards the
   development of cognitive skills of the student with training more
   flexible and student-centered. This phenomenon has also influenced in
   dentistry and dental education specifically supported in instructional
   videos has proven helpful in preclinical learning of difficult
   procedures for the student. In order to facilitate self-learning of
   students and their independence from traditional teaching methods, and
   with the institutional support from the University Complutense of
   Madrid, through 2 Projects for Innovation and Improvement of Teaching
   Quality (2010 and 2011 PIMCD), we have developed and implemented a
   teaching material (instructional videos) to learn techniques for
   restoring primary teeth in a preclinical teaching context. To check its
   effectiveness compared to the traditional method of teaching based on
   the theoretical exposition with the support of images, without the
   dynamism of the video, and without the student's self-learning facility,
   we evaluated the final product (cavities made in primary teeth of resin)
   in preclinical practices of two groups of students, one who has received
   instructional videos (3 rd Grade of Dentistry) and another one that has
   not received this support. All pupils have had since the beginning of
   the evaluation, the matrix, which are the criteria to take into account.
   We present the results of the evaluation of occlusal cavities (Class I)
   in primary molars performed by 20 students in each group. Working time
   was similar in both groups. Students who have received the videos have
   become more autonomous learners and they appreciated the possibility of
   consultation throughout the process and, like the most negative aspect,
   the lack of closer contact with professors of the practice. We have
   obtained superior scores in some of the criteria and molars evaluated.
   Students in 4th grade required a longer explanation, and they evaluated
   positively teacher's mentoring, but they would have preferred a more
   dynamic way. Teachers rated mor positively the incorporation of the
   videos to facilitate a more accurate explanation of the practice.
   We believe that the videos provide great benefits for both, students and
   teachers, in learning processes because the dynamism of the moving image
   reproduces more faithfully the practice. The help of tutorial video does
   not eliminate the work of teachers, who should reinforce the student's
   contents.},

Abstract = {Investigating the temporal order of regulatory processes can explain in
   more detail the mechanisms behind success or lack of success during
   collaborative learning. The aim of this study is to explore the
   differences between high- and low-challenge collaborative learning
   sessions. This is achieved through examining how the three phases of
   self-regulated learning occur in a collaborative setting and the types
   of interaction associated with these phases. The participants were
   teacher training students (N = 44), who worked in groups on a complex
   task related to didactics of mathematics during 6 weeks. The
   participants were instructed to use an application that was designed to
   increase awareness of the cognitive, motivational and emotional
   challenges the group might face. Based on the application's log files,
   the sessions were categorized into low- and high-challenge sessions. The
   video data from each session were coded based on the self-regulation
   phases and the types of interaction. The frequencies of the phases and
   the types of interaction were calculated for each session, and process
   discovery methods were applied using the heuristic miner algorithm. The
   results show no significant differences between the sessions in the
   frequency of phases. However, the process models of the two sessions
   were different: in the high-challenge sessions, the groups switched
   between the forethought and performance phases more. In conclusion, the
   regulation phases and types of interaction that contribute to successful
   collaboration differ in high- and low challenge sessions and support for
   regulated learning is needed especially at the middle of the learning
   process.},

Title = {Understanding Learner Continuance Intention: A Comparison of Live Video
   Learning, Pre-Recorded Video Learning and Hybrid Video Learning in
   COVID-19 Pandemic},

Abstract = {In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergency policy for online
   learning at home has been launched in China. Live video, prerecorded
   video, and their combination are the three main video learning modes.
   Parental involvement emerges as a unique factor that may influence
   online learning effects. Students' behaviors such as interaction,
   engagement may vary from traditional online learning context due to
   multiple reasons. Hence, the previous acceptance models are not
   applicable. In this paper, by modifying and extending the Expectation
   Confirmation Model, a unified acceptance and continuance intention model
   (UACIM) is proposed to explore the factors affecting students online
   learning continuance intention. Confirmation is omitted for the lack of
   a priori knowledge. Perceived ease of use is included as the factor
   assessing technology performance. Parental involvement, interaction, and
   students' engagement are considered as external variables. The
   hypotheses are validated by the data collected from 306,139 students
   from Grade 4 to Grade 9 in Hubei Province, China. The results of
   structural equation modeling reveal that all variables are significant
   in explaining continuance intention, which indicates the vital roles of
   the external factors. Some negative correlations are found with
   suggestions that practitioners should be prudent when implementing
   interactions as well as offering individualized instructional designs.
   Furthermore, three video learning modes are found to be successful. The
   most preferable way is the hybrid mode with the most interactions,
   engagement, strongest satisfaction, perceived usefulness, and
   continuance intention. There are significant differences among three
   groups for most paths. Therefore, appropriate interventions can be
   devised to enhance learning effects and continuance intention when
   utilizing different video learning.},

   A quantitative research and an illustrative case-study are presented.
   Results of the research suggest that the positive video feedback
   provides a valuable opportunity for personal, professional and social
   development for both teachers and pupils across the range of contexts.
   These investigations have shown that the VIG improves the communication
   skills and self-esteem of student teachers, therefore enhances effective
   learning and teaching and minimises negative contact, e.g.
   misunderstanding, inattention or conflict. The student teachers have
   started fully enjoy the teaching, being energized by it.},

Title = {A Meta-analysis Evaluating the Effectiveness of Instructional Video
   Technologies},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 12},
Abstract = {In the information and technology era, instructional video technologies
   have become popular teaching approaches and attracted academic interest.
   A growing body of literature has investigated various instructional
   video technologies and identified influencing factors on their
   effectiveness. However, the findings on the effectiveness of
   instructional video technologies are inconsistent. This study conducts a
   meta-analysis based on 50 included studies, evaluating the effectiveness
   of different instructional video technologies, effectiveness indicators,
   educational levels, and countries. This study examines three subgroups
   of instructional video technologies, finding that in-class video clips
   (d = 0.688, 95\% CI = {[}0.488, 0.888]) enhance learning effectiveness
   more significantly than outside-class video clips (d = -0.144, 95\% CI =
   {[}-0.634, 0.346]) and video games (d = 0.879, 95\% CI = {[}-0.038,
   1.796]). Instructional video technologies enhance learning motivations
   (d = 0.583, 95\% CI = {[}0.123, 1.044]) and practical skill learning (d
   = 0.493, 95\% CI = {[}0.010, 0.975]) more significantly than knowledge
   acquisition (d = 0.477, 95\% CI = {[}0.273, 0.682]). Students in primary
   and middle schools (d = 0.640, 95\% CI = {[}0.317, 0.963]) and adults (d
   = 0.501, 95\% CI = {[}0.146, 0.856]) benefit from instructional video
   technologies more significantly than undergraduates (d = 0.438, 95\% CI
   = {[}0.147, 0.728]). The effectiveness of instructional video
   technologies varies across countries. The findings may shed light on
   future study directions on instructional video technologies and promote
   the designs and applications of emerging video technologies in
   educational contexts.},

Title = {Enhancing OSCE preparedness with video exemplars in undergraduate
   nursing students. A mixed method study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {54},
Pages = {56-61},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Background: Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs) are
   designed to assess clinical skill performance and competency of students
   in preparation for `real world' clinical responsibilities. OSCEs are
   commonly used in health professional education and are typically
   associated with high levels of student anxiety, which may present a
   significant barrier to performance. Students, including nursing
   students, have identified that flexible access to exemplar OSCEs might
   reduce their anxiety and enable them to better prepare for such
   examinations.
   Aim: To implement and evaluate an innovative approach to preparing
   students for OSCEs in an undergraduate (registration) acute care nursing
   course. Method A set of digitized OSCE exemplars were prepared and
   embedded in the University-based course website as part of usual course
   learning activities. Use of the exemplars was monitored, pre and post
   OSCE surveys were conducted, and qualitative data were collected to
   evaluate the approach. OSCE grades were also examined.
   Findings: The online OSCE exemplars increased self-rated student
   confidence, knowledge, and capacity to prepare and provided clarity
   around assessment expectations. OSCE exemplars were accessed frequently
   and positively received; but did not impact on performance.
   Conclusion: Video exemplars aid student preparation for OSCEs, providing
   a flexible, innovative and clear example of the assessment process.
   Video exemplars improved self-rated student confidence and understanding
   of performance expectations, leading to increased engagement and reduced
   anxiety when preparing for the OSCE, but not overall OSCE performance.
   Such OSCE exemplars could be used to increase staff capacity and improve
   the quality of the student learning experience.},

Journal = {INTERNET AND HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {This study examined learning processes in undergraduate online general
   chemistry courses. The study aimed to characterize learners according to
   their learning patterns and to identify indicators that predict
   students' success in an online environment. Specifically, we focused on
   the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses:
   self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a
   mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and
   statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a
   decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict
   completion of the course: the submission status of an optional
   assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP).
   Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of
   implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns
   in online courses and to design future effective interventions are
   discussed. Regarding students, we emphasize the importance of time
   management and how choices they make with respect to their learning
   process affect their potential for success.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this pilot study was to examine if tablet technology with
   accompanying instructional videos enhanced the teaching and learning
   outcomes in a preclinical dental laboratory setting. Two procedures
   deemed most challenging in Operative Dentistry II were chosen for the
   development of instructional videos. A random sample of thirty students
   was chosen to participate in the pilot. Comparison of faculty
   evaluations of the procedures between the experimental (tablet) and
   control (no tablet) groups resulted in no significant differences;
   however, there was a trend toward fewer failures in the experimental
   group. Examination of the ability to accurately self-assess was compared
   by exploring correlations between faculty and student evaluations. While
   correlations were stronger in the experimental group, the control group
   had significant correlations for all three procedures, while the
   experimental group had significant correlations on only two of the
   procedures. Students strongly perceived that the tablets and videos
   helped them perform better and more accurately self-assess their work

Abstract = {Some research has shown that using videos in online courses can promote
   learner's connection to the instructor (Banerjee et al., 2020). This
   quasi-experimental self-study aimed to explore the impact of brief
   three-minute instructor-generated videos in twin segments of an online
   graduate teacher education seminar focused on Globalization,
   Communities, and Schools. Specifically, we sought to understand the
   extent to which the insertion of these videos influenced teacher
   candidates' perceptions of the dynamics of a Community of Inquiry (CoI)
   and their overall satisfaction as learners. The quantitative analysis of
   survey data using T-tests showed no statistically significant difference
   in overall learner satisfaction, social presence, teaching presence, or
   instructor social presence between the course with and without videos.
   However, there were significant differences in several individual items
   within each survey instrument. Student interviews and course evaluation
   comments were examined for themes revealing the strong presence of the
   instructor in various ways such as personalized feedback and caring
   tone. These findings suggest that while the videos may not have a
   significant impact on overall satisfaction, they do contribute to a more
   personalized and caring learning environment. Follow-up discussions with
   the instructor also revealed the reluctance to include short videos was
   grounded in his fear of inadvertently compromising the accessibility
   standards he wanted to honor-suggesting a continued need for growth in
   online instructors' digital competencies and additional research into
   the perceived obstacles of expanding modalities of online graduate
   teacher education.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Caregiver-implemented language programmes are effective
   for alleviating early language difficulties. This study examined the
   efficacy of a self-directed video-based caregiver-implement language
   programme in Chinese families. Method: This study consisted of two
   stages. In stage 1, 31 caregiver-child dyads (typically developing
   children) completed the training programme (group 1) in the form of six
   video-based training modules. In stage 2, 28 caregiver-child dyads
   (children with language difficulties) receiving active speech therapy
   were randomly assigned to the training (group 2) and control arms (group
   3). Group 2 received the same training as group 1 in addition to their
   regular therapy while group 3 was kept as status quo. Caregivers
   completed a quiz on their knowledge of language facilitation techniques
   (LFTs) and submitted caregiver-child interaction videos at the start and
   end of the training. Outcome measures included programme completion
   rate, quiz scores, and use of LFTs and children's communication skills
   in the videos. A pre-post design and a between-group design were adopted
   in the stage 1 and 2 studies, respectively. Results: A completion rate
   of about 60\% in both stages was noted. Significantly higher
   post-training knowledge scores were found in groups 1 and 2. General but
   nonsignificant growth in use of parallel talk and gesture, and
   significant gains in children's vocalization in the training arm were
   observed. Conclusion: The self-directed video-based training programme
   would be useful in imparting information to caregivers. However, the
   modest improvements in the use of LFTs suggested direct coaching
   appeared to still play a significant role in enhancing the actual
   implementation of LFTs. Further investigation on a larger scale is
   required to evaluate the effectiveness of the training programme for
   promoting the wider use of this mode as a preventive measure.},

Abstract = {Foreign languages have become a necessary component of education, and
   computer technologies have changed the very process of knowledge
   acquisition due to distant learning. Practical orientation of
   professional and non-professional communication causes the necessity of
   combining two the most important approaches to foreign language
   teaching: student-centered (distant) and communicative
   (classroom-based). This can be successfully realized through blended
   learning, i.e. combination of traditional and distant methods.
   The present article deals with changing ratio of distant and traditional
   components in the course of blended learning, this ratio being dependent
   on educational aims and tasks. Distant methods may function differently:
   to intensify leaning by on-line access to a great number of information
   sources (textual, video, audio );
   to facilitate students' independent studying which covers up to half
   curriculum time;
   to create a personal learning path;
   to homogenize the students' foreign language level;
   to stimulate self-education and long-life learning.
   Blended leaning is widely and successfully implemented in our university
   for different purposes. Thus, two years ago the Department of Foreign
   Languages carried out the experiment of leveling the factual 1st year
   students' knowledge of foreign language through their individual e-work
   so that to facilitate successful mastering the university course. The
   experiment statistics presented in the article show the considerable
   lessening of difference in students' foreign language level after four
   months.
   Other examples of well balanced and productive implementation of blended
   learning are given and a new multi-functional role of a teacher is
   described in the article.},

Abstract = {Purpose
   The purpose of this study is to explore the characteristics and
   potential effects of teaching and learning through audio
   teleconferencing (dial-in) with a cell phone. In addition, the study
   aims to identify the associations between the audio teleconferencing and
   video teleconferencing in a 12-week postgraduate course.
   Design/methodology/approach
   The study is a cross-sectional survey conducted at the Department of
   Educational Innovations at the Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and
   Technology from March to June 2020. The purposive sampling technique was
   used to sample 100 postgraduate students who registered for a course in
   the department. The data for the study were collected using the System
   Usability Scale (SUS) and 17-item self-administered eQuestionnaire.
   Multiple Linear Regression analysis, ANOVA, Independent sample T-test
   and Mann-Whitney U-test were used to estimate the differences in course
   achievements of students who experienced education through audio
   teleconferencing and those who experienced education through video
   teleconferencing.
   Findings
   In total, 59\% of the participating postgraduate students chose to
   attend the synchronous online lectures via audio teleconferencing
   (dial-in). The participants gave a high SUS score (SUS > 80.3; Grade A;
   Excellent) for audio conferencing service. Among the students in the
   audio teleconferencing cohort, the results evidenced a strong positive
   linear correlation, (r (57) = 0.79, p < 0.05), between the individual
   adjective ratings and the SUS scores. There was marginal significance
   among demography of students in the audio teleconference (AT) cohort
   with regards to their perception about the dial-in lecture. There was no
   statistically significant difference, (t (98) = 1.88, p = 0.063), in the
   achievement test for AT students and video teleconference (VT) students.
   The instructors and the students were satisfied with the AT.
   Practical implications
   Based on the students' preference, AT offers equal benefit as VT with
   regards to system satisfaction and perceived quality of online teaching.
   AT, as teaching modality, should be an option for students who reside in
   communities with high latency internet connectivity. It is recommended
   that instructors are trained on how to engage and motivate students via
   AT.
   Originality/value
   Higher education institutions in Ghana are facing decisions about how to
   continue learning and teaching through flexible pedagogy, while keeping
   their faculty members and students protected from the COVID-19 pandemic.
   Many of these institutions have canceled the brick-and-mortar education
   and other conventional learning practices and have instructed faculty to
   adopt online teaching through synchronous video teleconferencing
   platforms. However, the learning experience is not the same for students
   who reside in remote or rural communities with low bandwidth. There is
   very little research in this topic, especially in developing countries
   like Ghana, and the present study aims to bridge the gap in the
   literature by exploring the characteristics and potential effects of
   teaching and learning through audio teleconferencing (dial-in) with a
   cell phone, in the context of a 12-week postgraduate course.},

Abstract = {With this paper the authors' intent to analyse and discuss the design
   process of a Technology-Enhanced Learning Environment (TELE) for
   promoting youngsters' Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) of industrial and
   technical skills in non-formal learning settings. The experience is
   grounded on Think Industry Technology Project (TITP). TITP is a
   hands-on, out of school project running in the Technological Centre
   (CATIM) since 1995 that encompassed, until the present date, more than
   11000 youngsters with ages between 13 and 17 years old. The main
   objective for TITP is to develop a positive vision of industry, of
   employment opportunities and technical careers related to the industrial
   sector, towards a sustainable and active citizenship. This objective is
   to be achieved through the acquisition of skills rather than on the mere
   accumulation of information and on out-of-school time. There are several
   project' activity branches: Laboratory Think Industry (LabTI),
   Technology Think Industry (TecTI), F1 in Schools Think Industry (F1STI).
   All these branches encompass different activities with complex tasks and
   were designed to be fostered with technology. Technology itself it's not
   a problem, the added value to the promotion of SRL in youngsters' rests
   on the pedagogical approach underneath. Research has shown that
   youngsters have a set of common self-regulatory strategies and an
   individualized set of skills that allow each youngster to be successful
   in school, society, life and in the future at work. There are evidences
   that strongly suggest that these competencies can be taught, learned,
   mediated and controlled. Based on these principles the TELE was
   developed, and it was taken in account: a) methods for organization and
   time management; b) types of work patterns; c) Self-regulation
   strategies; d) goal orientation; e) tutoring model; f) skills to be
   developed and outputs to be achieved. The first part of TELE strategy
   was based on the tailoring of a commercial, regular Learning Management
   System (LMS) that includes several features such has synchronous and
   asynchronous communication tools (e. g. chat, video-conferencing,
   forums, document exchange areas, wikis, blogs), workflow management,
   group work management, web analytic tools, social tools. The technology
   is the same for every group and/or individual in the project, although
   the final shape of the environment is unique for each one. The learning
   environment is a dynamic space that is tailored ``just-in-time{''} and
   in a responsive way to the group personality. Is the individuality of
   each group that allows the tutors to adapt the learning environment to
   the work patterns shown by the youngsters. With this paper the authors
   will discuss the way in which the individual and group strategies are
   reflected and potentiated by technology for attaining to the task
   objectives. These strategies include (but are not limited to): a)
   organizing and transforming information; b) planning and setting goals;
   c) records and monitoring; d) written/oral memorization/acquisition
   strategies; e) behavioural strategies; f) environmental strategies.
   Some of the main project reflections are: a) youngsters who are able to
   regulate their behavior tent to achieve better and have other positive
   development outcomes that can be generalized to everyday life
   functioning; b) giving meaning to curricula and activities is one of the
   most value strategy by youngsters; c) technology and technological
   learning environments are no problem is this equation, there is
   sufficient and quality offer in the market (commercial and free); d) the
   correct pedagogical approach will enhance technology learning contexts
   results; e) The TELE must be adapted to each user/group of users; f) We
   don't need complex environments to promote learning and development
   ``Keep it simple!{''}.},

Abstract = {Purpose - This study investigates the effect of digital multimodal
   composing (DMC) on student motivation and literacy in English as a
   Foreign Language (EFL) contexts. It explores how students engaged in
   creating digital animations to respond to literary texts and the
   implications for integrating DMC into traditional literacy practices.
   Grounded in social semiotic theory and Self-Determination Theory, this
   study aims to understand how digital composing influences student
   engagement, motivation and literacy development.
   Design/methodology/approach - Qualitative data were gathered over a
   six-month period using a combination of student surveys, semi-structured
   interviews, reflection logs and student-produced scripts/ animations.
   This study focused on two university students who engaged in multimodal
   projects as part of their extracurricular EFL activities, examining
   their processes and reflections. Findings - Students demonstrated strong
   intrinsic motivation during DMC processes, largely due to the social
   affordances provided by digital multimodal composing. By combining
   traditional literacy skills with digital practices, students experienced
   enhanced creative expression, enhanced meaning-making and a deeper
   understanding of literary texts through the production and sharing of
   animated videos. This process promoted both emotional and cognitive
   engagement, emphasizing the importance of teacher guidance and digital
   tools in creating a more dynamic and supportive learning environment.
   Practical implications - This study outlines a practical approach to DMC
   through a structured process: selecting and reading a book, proposing a
   change as if requesting it from the author, creating and sharing a video
   on YouTube to explain the change and reflecting on the experience. This
   approach can guide educators in designing activities that deepen student
   engagement, enhance critical thinking and integrate digital tools with
   traditional learning methods. Originality/value - This study contributes
   to the understanding of how digital technologies can transform
   traditional literacy practices, offering insights into the benefits of
   multimodal composition for language learning and motivation in EFL
   contexts. It provides practical examples of how students and teachers
   can leverage digital tools to enhance literacy education and prepare
   students for 21st-century challenges.},

Abstract = {Organisations are increasingly relying on people analytics to aid human
   resources decision-making. One application involves using machine
   learning to automatically infer applicant characteristics from
   employment interview responses. However, management research has
   provided scant validity evidence to guide organisations' decisions about
   whether and how best to implement these algorithmic approaches. To
   address this gap, we use closed vocabulary text mining on mock video
   interviews to train and test machine learning algorithms for predicting
   interviewee's self-reported (automatic personality recognition) and
   interviewer-rated personality traits (automatic personality perception).
   We use 10-fold cross-validation to test the algorithms' accuracy for
   predicting Big Five personality traits across both rating sources. The
   cross-validated accuracy for predicting self-reports was lower than
   large-scale investigations using language in social media posts as
   predictors. The cross-validated accuracy for predicting interviewer
   ratings of personality was more than double that found for predicting
   self-reports. We discuss implications for future research and practice.},

Abstract = {Objectives: The first 2 weeks following release from prison are
   associated with extraordinary risk of fatal drug overdose. However,
   bystanders can reverse opioid overdoses using rescue breathing and
   naloxone, an overdose antidote. We reviewed overdose prevention and
   naloxone administration training videos for incarceration-specific and
   behaviour change theory-specific content and then developed a video that
   addressed these gaps.
   Design: Systematic review of educational videos and community-based
   participatory video development process.
   Setting: Community-based organisations, correctional health programmes.
   Method: Video development proceeded as a community-informed, iterative
   process of creating and testing the acceptability of a new DVD among
   end-user populations, community and correctional staff. Data collection
   and video development advisory process included three focus groups with
   opioid users and formerly incarcerated individuals, two consultations
   with national expert groups and overdose prevention programme staff and
   ongoing informal presentations to correctional staff and leadership.
   Results: Of nine eligible and reviewed videos, three contained
   theory-based learning components, and only one also contained peer-based
   content; none directly addressed post-incarceration overdose prevention.
   The created 19-minute film, Staying Alive on the Outside, uses
   interviews, conversation and model training sessions by peers, who
   candidly discuss the challenges of re-entry from prison, opioid
   addiction and relapse and misconceptions about opioid tolerance and
   overdose. Viewers learn strategies to avoid overdose while using opioids
   and what to do in an overdose. Peer learners' and peer trainers' model
   the dissemination of education and naloxone administration.
   Conclusion: The DVD is currently used in several prisons and jails; a
   multi-site evaluation of programme effectiveness is discussed.},

Abstract = {The gamification approach is popular method in education as it has been
   widely utilized in many fields. The project focuses on designing a game
   for interactive learning of lean manufacturing activities to create an
   alternative learning method that would gain interest and efficiency in
   learning. Integration of gamification approach and interactive learning
   method was used to illustrate a virtual lean manufacturing education and
   training by means of users' interaction towards provided interactive
   learning materials and participation in playing the designed game. Input
   of the project which is learning materials was developed by analysing
   numerous articles regarding common lean manufacturing tools and
   practices. Interactive elements such as animation, sound effects,
   lecture voice, and videos were applied in each learning material to
   deliver an adequate understanding of each topic. Construction of the
   game platform is being developed using ActivePresenter software which
   includes simulation videos of the production line using FlexSim software
   to visualize a real production floor which provides a clearer picture of
   the production system for users. The game should include a basic
   assessment of lean manufacturing practices by considering its complexity
   and difficulty level for users with inadequate or does not have
   experience in the field. The outcome of the project is expected to
   successfully design a basic game platform for lean manufacturing
   education by means of interactive learning. Users will be able to learn
   lean manufacturing systems using the designed interactive learning
   materials included in the games and self-assess themselves as the game
   publishes the correct and best answer option in case they answer
   wrongly.},

Abstract = {Objectives: This study compared the effects of self-directed video
   prompting with error correction using an iPod Touch to least-to-most
   prompting on teaching vocational skills to two post-secondary students
   with moderate intellectual disabilities.
   Methods: Students were first taught to use the inPromptu mobile
   application on the iPod Touch. They were then taught to collate and pack
   a large envelope and to tri-fold papers and pack a business envelope.
   The two tasks were counterbalanced across students in an adapted
   alternating treatments design. Students were instructed to use
   self-directed video prompting with error correction to teach themselves
   one skill, and an instructor used least-to-most prompting to teach the
   second skill. Data were also collected on sessions to criterion and
   maintenance of the skills over time.
   Results: Results demonstrated that both instructional techniques were
   effective in teaching the skills, and students generalized their use of
   the technology to learn a new skill with no additional instruction.
   These results were replicated with one of the students.
   Conclusions: Self-directed video prompting with error correction and
   least-to-most prompting were nearly equivalent in terms of acquisition
   efficiency and maintenance. These findings suggest that self-directed
   video prompting with error correction could be used in vocational
   settings, allowing job coaches to fade more quickly and for adults with
   intellectual and developmental disabilities to be more independent.},

Title = {A theoretical understanding of self-paced learning},
Journal = {INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {414},
Pages = {319-328},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Self-paced learning (SPL) is a recently proposed methodology designed by
   mimicking through the learning principle of humans/animals. A variety of
   SPL realization schemes have been designed for different computer vision
   and pattern recognition tasks, and empirically demonstrated to be
   effective in these applications. However, the literature is in lack of
   the theoretical understanding of SPL. Regarding this research gap, this
   study attempts to provide some new theoretical understanding of the SPL
   scheme. Specifically, we prove that the solution strategy on SPL accords
   with a majorization minimization algorithm implemented on an implicit
   objective function. Furthermore, we found that the loss function
   contained in this implicit objective has a similar configuration with
   the non-convex regularized penalty (NCRP) known in statistics and
   machine learning. Such connection inspires us to discover more intrinsic
   relationships between the SPL regimes and the NCRP forms, like smoothly
   clipped absolute deviation (SCAD), logarithmic penalty (LOG) and
   non-convex exponential penalty (EXP). The insight of the robustness
   under SPL can then be finely explained. We also analyze the capability
   of SPL regarding its easy loss-prior embedding property, and provide an
   insightful interpretation of the effectiveness mechanism under current
   SPL variations. Moreover, we design a group-partial-order loss prior,
   which is especially useful for weakly labeled large-scale data
   processing tasks. By applying SPL with this loss prior to the FCVID
   dataset, which is currently one of the largest manually annotated video
   dataset, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance above existing
   methods, which further supports the proposed theoretical arguments. (C)

Abstract = {Behavioral engagement in an online setting can be described as an
   on-task performance done by the students (Moser \& Smith, 2015). This
   refers to how active the students are during synchronous learning using
   the features of the video conferencing applications such as opening
   their camera, speaking through the microphone, screen sharing contents,
   and using the chat box to answer and respond to questions (Al Mamun et
   al, 2016; Park \& Bonk, 2007). This study describes the use of video
   conferencing applications in facilitating behavioral engagement during
   synchronous learning. 462 Grades 11 and Grade 12 students and five (5)
   teachers were invited to answer a self-report questionnaire. The results
   indicated that teachers provided opportunities for behavioral engagement
   to happen during synchronous learning by making the features always
   available for the students to use. Further, the study showed a very weak
   relationship between the challenges encountered by the students and the
   students' perception of the use of video conferencing applications
   contradicting other literature suggesting that the two variables affect
   each other. Moreover, this study found out a moderately strong
   relationship between the frequency of use of the features and the
   students' perception on the use of video conferencing application during
   synchronous learning.},

Title = {Video-Assisted Versus Traditional Problem-Based Learning: A
   Quasi-Experimental Study Among Pediatric Nursing Students},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NURSING RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {31},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe text-assisted problem-based, methods traditionally used to
   teach nursing students cannot adequately simulate holistic clinical
   situations and patient symptoms. Although video-assisted, problem-based
   learning methods combined with text have shown positive results in terms
   of improving comprehension and cognitive abilities, some studies have
   shown these methods to be inferior to text-assisted methods in terms of
   promoting deep critical thinking in medical students.PurposeThis study
   was designed to assess the benefits in nursing education of
   video-assisted, problem-based learning using online multimedia
   technologies compared with text-assisted, problem-based learning using
   traditional face-to-face classes.MethodsA quasi-experimental,
   nonequivalent control group, preintervention-and-postintervention design
   was used. The experimental group (n = 31) received video-assisted,
   problem-based learning materials with multimedia technologies (video
   scenarios, Google Docs worksheets, Google slides, Zoom cloud meetings,
   and e-learning management system) and weekly online lectures (100
   minutes) for 4 weeks. The control group (n = 35) received text-assisted,
   problem-based learning materials with traditional face-to-face classes
   and weekly lectures (100 minutes) for 4 weeks. The study data were
   analyzed using chi-square, Fisher's exact, and independent t tests as
   well as analysis of variance.ResultsAt posttest, learning motivation (t
   = 3.25, p = .002), academic self-efficacy (t = 2.41, p = .019), and
   self-directed learning (t = 3.08, p = .003) were significantly higher in
   the experimental group than in the control
   group.Conclusions/Implications for PracticeVideo-assisted, problem-based
   learning using multimedia technologies was shown to be effective in
   increasing learning motivation, academic self-efficacy, and
   self-directed learning in nursing students. These findings have
   implications for the development and planning of contactless classes in
   response to the coronavirus pandemic. Notably, no intergroup differences
   were found in terms of problem-solving skills. Future studies should
   include in-depth reviews and assessments of the difficulties faced in
   producing problem scenarios as well as the methods of instruction.},

Abstract = {The current research aims to investigate information visualization found
   within students' self-regulated learning skills while they are engaged
   in an interactive learning module. While the cognitive actions represent
   contextual activities found when students use interactive learning
   modules, the metacognitive component was represented by planning,
   monitoring, and regulating strategies. Students at two high schools in
   the state of Utah located in the United States of America were the
   target research population. They enrolled in programming and math
   classes offered by School ABC and physics class offered by School XYZ.
   Data was selected from eight students who completed activities in this
   study. This study particularly focuses on the Boolean Logic module.
   Screencaptured videos were used in this study. Additionally, a proposed
   design of self-regulated learning strategy visualization was also
   provided.},

Title = {ONLINE LEARNING MOTIVATION DURING COVID-19 PANDEMIC: THE ROLE OF
   LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, STUDENT SELF-EFFICACY AND LEARNER-INSTRUCTOR
   INTERACTION},
Journal = {MALAYSIAN JOURNAL OF LEARNING \& INSTRUCTION},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Purpose - Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Malaysian government
   declared a Movement Control Order (MCO) to prevent the spread of the
   virus. Educational institutions were forced to switch their pedagogy to
   online learning to complete the semester curriculum, catching
   academicians and students off-guard that resulted in makeshift online
   lesson delivery. Previous online learning motivation studies have
   neglected the impact of an unplanned or sudden transition to online
   learning during a pandemic on student motivation to learn. This study
   aims to examine location learning environment, learner-instructor
   interactions, and self-efficacy of students more succinctly on their
   learning motivation during an unplanned transition to online learning.
   Method - This study used a sequential explanatory mixed method strategy
   with a sample size of 535 randomly collected from a public and two
   private higher education institutions in Malaysia. IBM SPSS statistical
   software v22 was used for descriptive statistics. Regression testing was
   carried out using AMOS statistical software v21 structural equation
   modeling.
   Findings - Revealed the importance of location learning environment in
   fostering student motivation and the positive influence of
   learner-instructor interactions on students achieving the desired
   learning outcomes during an unplanned transition to online learning.
   However, there is no evidence to suggest a causal effect between student
   self-efficacy and online learning motivation during such conditions. The
   theoretical implication indicates that having conducive hygiene factors
   are essential to driving student motivation under such situations.
   Significance - The COVID-19 pandemic provides opportunities for
   researchers to examine the role of various motivational theories to
   explain student motivation in learning under challenging conditions.
   Educators and students would benefit on ways to increase student online
   learning motivation in lockdown conditions. Setting up a more efficient
   online delivery approach could lead to higher student satisfaction and
   potential enrolment.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of a video tutorial for
   software training whose construction was based on a combination of
   insights from multimedia learning and Demonstration-Based Training. In
   the videos, a model of task performance was enhanced with instructional
   features that were intended to be particularly effective insofar as they
   addressed four key processes in observational learning (i.e., attention,
   retention, reproduction and motivation). An experiment with two
   conditions was reported. The control condition consisted of only
   demonstration videos. The experimental condition included a review after
   task demonstration to provide additional support for retention. The
   videos taught Word formatting tasks. The 73 participants came from
   elementary and secondary school. During training, video playing was
   followed by task practice. After training, a post-test was administered.
   Engagement data showed that demonstration videos were played almost
   completely (93\%). Reviews fared worse (32\%). Motivation increased
   significantly with training regardless of condition. Task performance
   also increased significantly from pre-test (29\%) to training (84\%) and
   post-test (71\%). In addition, results for performance during and after
   training were significantly better for the experimental condition than
   the control condition. The discussion argues that the demonstration
   videos provide a viable way to support task completion. To further
   improve learning, better understanding of learners' retention processes
   is needed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Abstract = {The use of online teaching mode has grown rapidly in recent years,
   particularly under the COVID-19 pandemic. To promote the learning
   motivation of students and teaching effectiveness, development of
   attractive online teaching material such as videos is important. In the
   present study, we developed 15 theory-related videos and 9 case-based
   videos in the context of a leadership course focusing on psychological
   well-being and psychosocial competence. Using a qualitative research
   methodology via focus groups (N = 48 students) to evaluate these videos,
   six themes emerged from the data, including video arrangement, design of
   videos, content of videos, benefits to students' pre-lesson
   self-learning, benefits to students' learning of course content, and
   contribution to students' class participation. The findings suggest that
   the videos can elicit positive perceptions of the students in a flipped
   classroom arrangement. Students also benefit from the videos in terms of
   their understanding of course content and their participation in class
   discussion. Besides, the study suggests that the videos promote the
   learning efficiency of the students. The present qualitative findings
   concurred with the previous quantitative findings, suggesting the value
   of using virtual teaching and learning to promote psychosocial
   competence in university students.},

Abstract = {Recently it was developed within the universe of Polytechnic of Porto
   through the efforts union of a teacher and a student an application that
   lets anyone record video lessons in a simple, fast and intuitive way.
   The application was called initially EduGraal and intended to be
   according to their creators a simple and intuitive lecture recorder
   solution which did not require additional hardware and that could
   provide teachers means capable to simulate a real lesson.
   This recorded video lesson could after be easily distribute on the Web
   (ex. on YouTube) or be putted in a LMS (such as Moodle) inside a course.
   The solution now called Easy2Rec and it success results of its
   simplicity and potential to create educational content.
   Easy2Rec was recently adopted in all the IES (Higher education
   institutions) of Portugal once the Portuguese NREN (National Research
   and Education Network) FCT/FCCN (Foundation for National Scientific
   Computing) has established a strategic partnership with the startup
   company (Easy2rec) in sense to provide a solution dedicated to the
   recording of cultural and educational contents that could be mostly used
   on educational environments.
   The main purpose of this document is to present a study case that used
   this intuitive lecture recorder in order to contribute to better
   learning of the Portuguese language by students of high schools.
   The main features of Easy2rec are:
   Ability to capture the most common educational content such as PPT, PDF,
   Browser accessories, Images, Videos and Whiteboard and the user at the
   same time;
   Ability to capture the entire desktop or just a given application;
   Ability to capture video through a second camera;
   Ability to record audio, video and data;
   HD recording of up to 4k;
   Possibility of using external hardware;
   Good personalization.
   This study involved several students, teachers and schools and was
   integrated with some other educational activities based in technology.
   Students and teachers classified the activities mediated by Easy2Rec as
   the most interesting and the potential to support learning, especially
   in reading and speaking skills.
   It was found that the students were trying to improve and continuously
   overcome his performance improving to almost every iteration.
   The motivation and interest in the use of Easy2Rec were notorious.
   The study revealed that this type of tools and educational activities
   can contribute significantly to the teaching of the mother tongue,
   making the process more fun and the ability to engage the wave students
   each intends to surpass himself as if they were playing a game.
   This solution reveals great potential in the delivery of homework
   activities and students related that was very useful in the
   self-assessment and self-criticism process.
   In an era where it is notorious the difficulty of communication and
   expression, mainly among young people this study shows the potential use
   of a specific technology.},

Abstract = {Educational technology plays an important role in the life of a medical
   student. The potential for virtual reality (VR) to enhance medical
   education has been discernible for more than 40 years; however, it has
   not been available due to the associated high costs {[}1]. With the
   advancement and affordability of three-dimensional (3D) technology, the
   introduction of virtual and augmented reality has the potential to
   change the way in which medical students learn today. Currently,
   teaching tools consist of a multitude of materials, from traditional
   resources such as books to more modern web-based videos, which provide
   students with extra study material in an effort to promote self-directed
   learning {[}2]. 3D learning objects have the potential to provide an
   alternative immersive learning tool for medical students to comprehend
   complex structures found within the medical education curricula {[}3],
   {[}4]. Furthermore, we can take this one step further by introducing 3D
   learning objects into virtual reality learning environments (VRLE's)
   {[}5]. VRLE's can assist in self-directed learning by providing an
   enhanced learning and understanding of invisible concepts, such as those
   found within the obstetrics and gynaecology curriculum. This study is
   based on the aforementioned concepts, which are used to develop an
   immersive 3D learning tool. This work-in-progress paper focuses on
   outlining the workflow process of the development of VR Baby, in which
   3D learning objects are created for implementation into a VRLE, for
   future use within the medical education setting.},

Title = {Self-HCL: Self-Supervised Multitask Learning with Hybrid Contrastive
   Learning Strategy for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis},

Abstract = {Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) plays a critical role in many
   applications, including customer service, personal assistants, and video
   understanding. Currently, the majority of research on MSA is focused on
   the development of multimodal representations, largely owing to the
   scarcity of unimodal annotations in MSA benchmark datasets. However, the
   sole reliance on multimodal representations to train models results in
   suboptimal performance due to the insufficient learning of each unimodal
   representation. To this end, we propose Self-HCL, which initially
   optimizes the unimodal features extracted from a pretrained model
   through the Unimodal Feature Enhancement Module (UFEM), and then uses
   these optimized features to jointly train multimodal and unimodal tasks.
   Furthermore, we employ a Hybrid Contrastive Learning (HCL) strategy to
   facilitate the learned representation of multimodal data, enhance the
   representation ability of multimodal fusion through unsupervised
   contrastive learning, and improve the model's performance in the absence
   of unimodal annotations through supervised contrastive learning.
   Finally, based on the characteristics of unsupervised contrastive
   learning, we propose a new Unimodal Label Generation Module (ULGM) that
   can stably generate unimodal labels in a short training period.
   Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI
   demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {The significance of self-regulated learning (SRL) among university
   students have caught the attention of recent research. A recent research
   has produced SRL process mapping but the research was limited to
   producing a simulation video from historical data to prove the
   occurrence of SRL processes in online learning management system. This
   paper proposes to extend that research by adopting the concept of
   personal knowledge management (PKM) using the GUSC Model, to design an
   agent-based SRL simulation. This would enable real-time data to be
   analysed as and when it is needed for prediction of SRL activities. The
   design of the multi-agent system is possible with the availability of
   data and knowledge on how these data could be interpreted by the
   software agents to present an SRL process in both graphical and text
   report forms. This paper presents the process of analysing students'
   online SRL behaviour throughout a semester, taking into account a
   technical course as the benchmark case study, and designing the
   agent-based simulation for lecturers' prediction on students' online SRL
   behaviour. In order to do so, simulation video from the recent work is
   analysed to capture moment-to-moment SRL processes. The purpose of this
   analysis is mainly to facilitate the understanding of how software
   agents could be animated step by step. The results from this study is
   expected to be beneficial to the stakeholders of online education
   system. Future work will be on developing the agent-based simulation of
   SRL.},

Abstract = {Enhancing existing curricula to meet newly published adult-gerontology
   advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) competencies in an efficient
   manner presents a challenge to nurse educators. Incorporating shared,
   published electronic learning resources (ELRs) in existing or new
   courses may be appropriate in order to assist students in achieving
   competencies. The purposes of this project were to (a) identify relevant
   available ELR for use in enhancing geriatric APRN education and (b) to
   evaluate the educational utility of identified ELRs based on established
   criteria. A multilevel search strategy was used. Two independent team
   members reviewed identified ELR against established criteria to ensure
   utility. Only resources meeting all criteria were retained. Resources
   were found for each of the competency areas and included formats such as
   podcasts, Web casts, case studies, and teaching videos. In many cases,
   resources were identified using supplemental strategies and not through
   traditional search or search of existing geriatric repositories.
   Resources identified have been useful to advanced practice educators in
   improving lecture and seminar content in a particular topic area and
   providing students and preceptors with additional self-learning
   resources. Addressing sustainability within geriatric APRN education is
   critical for sharing of best practices among educators and for
   sustainability of teaching and related resources. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Abstract = {In this paper we present the results of two complementary Teaching
   Innovation Projects aimed at designing and developing multimedia
   didactic materials to help students acquire the necessary background to
   face the first-year Physics course at some of the University of Cadiz
   technical BSc degrees. The most common educational needs observed among
   such students include an insufficient background knowledge in physics
   and mathematics which result in a high number of students failing to
   learn the subject of Physics and pass the exams. A collaborative effort
   has been made among various lecturers to create didactic materials using
   different technologies (interactive whiteboard, digital drawing tablet,
   tablet PC, video camera). More specifically, 16 videos lasting 4 to 8
   minutes were developed focusing on explaining basic aspects such as the
   use of vectors in space to represent physical magnitudes, vector
   analysis, algebra, trigonometry, and geometry. The idea behind was to
   create virtual introductory and reinforcement lessons that could be
   consulted anytime by the students. The videos were made available online
   to the students, which were also asked to fill a simple online
   questionnaire about them. Results from the questionnaire show a high
   degree of acceptance among the students, which stated that the
   explanations were easy to follow (100\%), that the themes covered were
   very useful (100\%), or that they helped them to better understand the
   subject of Physics (83\%).},

Title = {Hands-on live demonstration vs. video-supported demonstration of an
   aesthetic composite restoration in undergraduate dental teaching},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {85},
Number = {6},
Pages = {802-811},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Purpose/Objectives: Live hands-on demonstration of dental procedures is
   a central format in undergraduate dental teaching. It captures the
   immediacy of the clinical situation and allows for direct communication
   between instructor and students, but it also requires an experienced
   instructor who is able to handle both the performed treatment and its
   visualization alongside the actual teaching. The aim of the present work
   is to compare the hands-on demonstration of a class IV composite
   restoration to a teaching format where the instructor guided the
   students through a prerecorded procedural video of the same treatment.
   Methods: The effect of both interventions on the students'
   self-perceived learning outcomes was analyzed by questionnaires
   (response rate 100\%) in a randomized controlled double-blind
   (participants, outcome assessor) parallel group design (September 10 to
   October 3, 2019). In-class discussions were explored qualitatively by
   thematic analysis.
   Results: Both teaching formats increased the students' self-reported
   motivation, self-efficacy, and patient-centeredness in a similar way,
   with no significant differences between interventions. During in-class
   discussions, both the instructor and the students were more active in
   the video group. In contrast to the hands-on group, discussions in the
   video group also involved patient-related topics, such as aesthetics and
   general health. The video-supported teaching format considerably reduced
   the amount of time spent on optimizing the visualization of the
   performed treatment.
   Conclusion: Video-supported instructor-guided demonstrations may
   represent a promising teaching format as an alternative to live hands-on
   demonstrations of dental procedures in undergraduate dental education.},

Abstract = {Today's society is moving towards new forms of education, both regulated
   and non-regulated. Learning in the 21st century uses frequently the
   B-Learning spaces. Those spaces allow to insert of hypermedia resources
   (videos, virtual laboratories...) that make easier the personalized
   monitoring of the student and process-oriented feedback in real time.
   Additionally, recent research has made new proposals of what has been
   called Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). These systems facilitate the
   development of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) and have been very
   effective to increasing students' motivation and achieving effective
   learning. In particular, the design of virtual classrooms where serious
   games techniques with SRL are used resemble to be really effective. This
   simulation structure together with the development of interactive
   activities with the computer in which a process-oriented feedback is
   included seems to enhance the motivation and creativity of the
   apprentices. It has been proven that the use of this methodology
   explains 72\% of the variance of the students' learning results.
   Therefore, throughout this paper we propose the design of a Virtual and
   Intelligent Classroom called SmartArt. This classroom can be adapted to
   different types of students interested in the History of Art. On the one
   hand, it adapts to the training needs of art history knowledges for
   different undergraduates, such as History and Heritage Degree, Media
   Communication Degree and Tourism Degree. Also, to non-regular students
   such as university extracurricular courses. The design of this virtual
   classroom is intended to be developed through integration in educational
   web platforms, such as Moodle, of serious games designed using 2D design
   implemented in the game engine Unreal Engine as a graphic adventure
   videogame. The different characters included in this graphic adventure
   explain the main milestones of the History of Art, focused in a first
   moment, in those corresponding to the Ancient and Medieval Ages, whose
   development is articulated in three different difficulty levels
   (Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced). The learning structure in this
   Virtual Classroom uses self-regulated questions about each learning
   milestone that is presented in the video game. It always starts from a
   previous knowledge analysis that is expanded with an interactive
   glossary, then serious games that include questions of inquiry, word
   games,... are proposed. Once the student gives an answer, he receives an
   answer with a justification for his success or failure by
   process-oriented feedback (he is redirected to the correct content).
   Likewise, each unit includes a rubric in which the student is given
   adjust information on the steps to achieve an effective learning. This
   proposal includes used examples of visualization of the different
   hypermedia resources and self-regulated design.},

Abstract = {Positioning theory helps to understand pre-service teachers' performance
   and their professional identity. In the Content and Language Integrated
   Learning (CLIL) approach, studying teachers' praxis from the positioning
   theory is relevant as integrating language and content is problematic
   for both in-service and pre-service teachers. Moreover, positioning
   theory could help teachers understand their teaching position. Video
   technology, as a valuable tool for teacher training, facilitates
   teachers' analysis of their own teaching praxis and more importantly, it
   can help develop teaching awareness. However, scarce literature is found
   on how video-analysis from the positioning theory may benefit teachers
   in CLIL contexts. The objective of this paper is to analyse the
   influence of video self-analysis on pre-service teachers' positions
   within CLIL settings. To conduct this research, pre-service teachers
   recorded and analysed a simulated CLIL lesson. Interviews were designed
   and administered to know the influence of video on participating
   teachers' positions. Video supported pre-service teachers noticing their
   praxis and the meaning of CLIL while operating changes on their
   positions. Knowing the evolution of pre-service teachers' positioning
   contributes to the understanding of their professional identity and to
   thinking about pre-service teachers' programmes to foster their
   awareness on teaching practice through video technology.},

Abstract = {This study evaluated the efficacy of video modeling delivered via a
   handheld device (video iPod) and the use of the system of least prompts
   to assist elementary-age students with transitioning between locations
   and activities within the school. Four students with autism learned to
   manipulate a handheld device to watch video models. An ABAB withdrawal
   design was used to evaluate a functional relation between video modeling
   and the percentage of independent transitions by the student. The data
   indicate that all participants began transitioning more independently
   after the intervention was introduced and that their performance
   decreased with withdrawal of intervention. These results are presented
   in the context of how a portable video delivery system can aid students
   who spend considerable portions of their day in general education
   settings where traditional means of delivering video models (e.g.,
   televisions and computers) may not be as accessible.},

Title = {Video Self-Modeling (VSM) as a Strategy to Instruct CFL Students'
   Sentence-Level Stress},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {23},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Sentence-level stress is one of the major means of expressing
   information focus in oral speaking, and it is of importance for Chinese
   as a foreign language (CFL) learners to accurately receive and send the
   right information in conversation. However, research related to teaching
   stress, especially sentence-level stress, is indeed scarce. In this
   study, we investigate whether video self-modeling (VSM) is applicable to
   improve CFL students' sentence-level stress. VSM, as an innovative
   strategy, only shows the positive targeted behavior by using videos or
   audios of oneself, and aims to decrease students' frustration and the
   negative influence caused by failed accomplishments. Twelve
   beginning-level CFL students, taken as the experimental group, received
   the edited perfect pronunciation audios with their own voice and used
   these own-voice audios to train their sentence-level stress. At the same
   time, another twelve advanced-level CFL students were taken as the
   control group, and received traditional instructional strategies from
   their class teacher. The whole training continued for ten sessions
   during a period of two and half months. Quantitative results show that
   with the help of VSM, CFL students' sentence-level stress improved
   significantly as compared to the control group, with increased scores on
   the pronunciation of sentence-level stress words and increased scores in
   all three parameters: pitch, intensity, and duration. A post-training
   survey revealed that the participants' preference for using their own
   voice as instructional material resulted in a feeling of success and
   satisfaction. The findings corroborate the importance of
   computer-assisted language learning in the second language (L2) field,
   and add solid evidence of using VSM in foreign-language training.},

Abstract = {ViduSign is a 2 year European Project that explores the creative use of
   video for the young hearing impaired and investigate how video can
   support creative discovery and problem-based learning. It uses a visual
   approach and work transversal, across different countries (Germany,
   Austria, Eslovenia, United Kindom and Spain) to promote visual, digital
   and literacy competences of young deaf people, aged 15 to, in the
   transition period from school to work.
   The availability and ease access to video shows that it is great medium
   for the deaf people, as it is built on visual competences. Visual
   expression can be regarded as the strongest cultural interface between
   hearing and non-hearing world. These competences will increase hearing
   impaired youngsters' potential for employment, by supporting additional
   competences, and will enable them to express themselves more freely
   through their own self-expression.
   The main aim of the project is to use creative video for teaching,
   learning and communication for the European deaf communities.
   In the project there are three work packages:
   (1) collecting best practices in the field of video education,
   (2) developing pilot video models and
   (3) creation of pedagogic materials.
   Based on the outcomes of the pre-research and with the inclusion of six
   pilot videos, the first ideas for the design of pedagogic materials will
   be collected. Deaf people will essentially participate in the creation
   of pedagogic materials, video production and subtitling, workshops and
   training as well as in the dissemination and promotion of the products.},

Abstract = {Online video lectures are widely used in e-learning environments. They
   provide several advantages for students such as preparing for class and
   controlling their learning pace. However, essential features of videos,
   such as transient information and learner control, can also increase
   learners' cognitive load and disorientation, particularly for learners
   with low prior knowledge. This study analyzed data collected from a
   questionnaire, students' examination and homework scores, and system
   logs to examine the effects of prior knowledge on the engagement level,
   frequency of viewing strategies used, attitudes, and learning
   performance of students who watched video lectures. The results showed
   that the students demonstrated the same engagement levels of watching
   video lectures, regardless of whether they had high or low prior
   knowledge. However, high prior knowledge learners used a higher
   frequency of viewing strategies, had a more positive attitude toward
   watching the video lectures, and exhibited higher learning performance
   than the low prior knowledge learners did. These results are discussed
   in this article, and several suggestions for personalized prior
   knowledge support are proposed.},

   watched one of five videos displaying a simulated student-robot
   interaction and rated their perceptions of the intrinsic motivation of
   the student in the videos and the type of support provided by the social
   robot. Overall, the motivating learning companion affected the perceived
   sense of relatedness and perceived level of anxiety of the student in
   the video, as well as the social robot's perceived support. Differences
   between the conditions are discussed.},

   identification as `gamers.' Drawing on a survey of 318 Year 3 (7-8 years
   old) students, the research identified boys' self-reported enjoyment for
   gaming, their frequency using digital devices, and their self-rated
   digital skills. Interviews with four boys from the survey also explored
   the lifeworlds of self-professed `gamers.' Findings point to the
   salience of games for many boys' emerging identities and the
   inter-related nature of their experiences. We argue that teachers can
   capitalise on the strength of video games to create `in-group' cultures
   and communities of practice in their classrooms to support learning.},

Abstract = {This study aims to assess the learning activities that students find
   most helpful in self-paced MOOC settings, develop a questionnaire, and
   determine the predictors of students' acceptance of H5P interactive
   content. This research is a quantitative study. The experimented details
   were obtained from an online questionnaire administered in Herbal
   Medicine MOOC offered by the Medical Pharmacy Department, Faculty of
   Medicine, and Universities Indonesia. The students' acceptance
   questionnaire was developed by modifying the Technology Acceptance Model
   (TAM) questionnaire. This questionnaire includes perceived ease of use
   and perceived usefulness. Although 145 students participated in this
   course, only 126 students took and completed the online questionnaires.
   A paired sample t-test was performed to assess students' learning
   activity preferences. The questionnaire was assessed by using validity
   and reliability tests. Multilinear regression and Pearson's correlation
   analysis were also performed to identify the correlation among
   variables. The results showed that documents, learning videos, and H5P
   interactive content were considered by students as the most helpful
   learning activities in a self-paced MOOC. However, there is a
   significant difference in students' preferences for these learning
   activities, both before and after the course. All the items of students'
   acceptance on the H5P interactive content questionnaire were validated
   and reliable.},

Abstract = {The technological innovations created paradigm shifts in online
   education. In the near future, many routine-oriented jobs will be filled
   with artificial intelligence. Educators have a daunting task to prepare
   their students for jobs that not yet been created. The digital
   generation requires from educators to reconsider preconceived notions
   about assessment and introduce authentic performance-based assessment in
   the online environment. In contrast with the traditional educational
   assessment methods focusing on standardized tests, memorization and
   recall of information, alternative assessment fosters the development of
   creativity, critical thinking, and problem-solving skills by using
   authentic real world tasks to support exploration, discovery, and
   problem-based learning for students with diverse learning styles. There
   are a multitude of alternative assessment strategies to help students
   develop the intrinsic motivation that will allow them to become lifelong
   learners. Blogs, journals, wikis, and digital portfolios are excellent
   tools for self-reflection and personal growth. The process of engaging
   online learners in the production of podcasts and video projects can
   motivate students to acquire in-depth knowledge of the subject they
   study. Involving students in peer review promotes collaborative
   learning, creative expression, reflection, and higher-order thinking
   skills. Educational games, simulations, and virtual environments change
   the way educators teach and assess their students. Traditional tests do
   not offer struggling students immediate feedback on their exact level of
   achievement. Adaptive assessment adjusts the difficulty of questions
   based on a student's response and customizes assessment for each student
   by providing a more accurate measurement of their skills, knowledge,
   abilities, attitudes, personality traits and educational achievements
   backed by automated psychometrics. The artificial-intelligence based
   assessment tools highlight the strengths and weaknesses of student
   knowledge, provide them with comprehensive reports, and offer students
   immersive learning environments for improving their knowledge to a
   desirable level. Rewarding student proficiency with digital badges
   engages students in learning and provides credentials for acquiring new
   skills. Fostering student intrinsic motivation and innovation by using
   creative assessment strategies prepares students for the fast-changing,
   culturally diverse, and the interconnected modern world.},

Abstract = {Technology is evolving rapidly and it is becoming harder to keep up its
   pace. At a university environment, important investments are required so
   that students and professors can have access to novel technology.
   However, it is also fundamental to know how to use this novel technology
   to exploit its benefits. TecnolOgico de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey,
   recently acquired several 3D printers so that the students could get
   familiar with this rapid prototyping technology and use them to deliver
   better quality projects. Nevertheless, the new challenge was to
   administrate the 3D printing process including 3D model verification,
   STL file generation, printing time and raw material. Since students were
   not familiar with 3D printing, the expert had to spend a lot of time
   with them explaining the whole process from the modelling to the
   printing stage, and verifying their work to make an efficient use of 3D
   printing time and materials. To overcome this situation, it was decided
   to make use of augmented reality and multimedia applications to generate
   tutorials for self-learning the whole process of 3D printing. Nowadays,
   the wide spread of mobile devices and wireless technologies brings a
   huge potential to e-learning changing dramatically the traditional
   instructor-oriented scheme. The learning process can take place in an
   informal setting having the tutorials available on mobile devices by
   just scanning a quick response code, usually known as QR code. The first
   QR code enables a link to download the free augmented reality Layar app.
   Then, several images can be scanned using Layar to open each of the
   video tutorials. These videos explain graphically step by step of all
   the processes involved and give different options of software to be
   used. The tutorials are easy to follow so that any engineering or design
   student can learn from them. This case-study offers an innovative
   learning approach that fosters self-learning and a more efficient use of
   technology resources. (C) 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Title = {Emotionally salient patient information enhances the educational value
   of surgical videos},
Journal = {ADVANCES IN HEALTH SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {25},
Number = {4},
Pages = {799-808},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Medical students' motivations for choosing a medical career are likely
   based on and remain tethered to the affectively-laden caring component
   of doctor-patient interactions. However, this component is rarely
   presented in educational surgical videos. It is unknown whether
   affectively engaging students by including patient-related emotionally
   salient information potentiates or draws focus away from learning a
   surgical procedure and whether such information affects motivation and
   attitudes toward the video. Therefore, we investigate whether presenting
   a patient's emotional state before video surgery enhances or weakens the
   educational value of that video. In a within-subjects crossover design,
   second-year medical students (n = 130) viewed video clips of surgeries.
   These videos, from online medical education platforms, were preceded by
   the patient's information from the original video or by information
   about the patient's preoperative emotional preparation. After each
   video, participants completed a multiple-choice test about the video's
   content to measure learning, answered a question about their motivation
   to re-watch the video, and completed an attitude scale regarding the
   video. Incorporating patient's information into surgical videos
   significantly enhanced students' acquisition of the technical aspects of
   surgery procedures (p < 0.0001), motivation to re-watch the video (p <
   0.001), and favorable attitudes toward the video (p = 0.02). These
   findings show that incorporating information about patients' emotional
   states may enhance students' positive attitudes and motivations toward
   educational videos and may improve their learning of surgical
   techniques. They also suggest that the role of this factor should be
   considered when developing guidelines for medical educational video
   release.},

Title = {Outcomes of video training on smoking cessation counseling for nurses},
Journal = {TOBACCO INDUCED DISEASES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {21},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION Lack of smoking cessation education hinders nurses in
   providing adequate tobacco cessation counseling. Video training on
   smoking cessation counseling for nurses was developed and assessed for
   its short-term outcomes on knowledge and self-efficacy. METHODS A
   quasi-experimental study using pretest-posttest design was conducted
   with nurses in Thailand in 2020. A total of 126 nurses received online
   video training. Patient-nurse role-playing was used to demonstrate
   cessation counseling for smokers who are in the contemplation and
   preparation stage. Motivational interviewing techniques were emphasized
   throughout the video. Knowledge and self-efficacy in smoking cessation
   counseling were assessed pre and post training by a questionnaire.
   RESULTS Comparisons of the pre and post training, mean score of
   knowledge (10.75 +/- 2.39 vs 13.01 +/- 2.86, t=7.716, p<0.001) and
   self-efficacy in smoking cessation counseling (3.70 +/- 0.83 vs 4.36 +/-
   0.58, t=11.187, p<0.001) were significantly increased. These positive
   learning outcomes were found in nurses with experience and no experience
   in cessation counseling (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS This study shows that
   video training can improve nurses' knowledge and confidence in smoking
   cessation counseling. It could therefore be included in nursing
   continuing education to improve nurses' knowledge and confidence in
   smoking cessation services.},

   participants. The language (i.e., English or Japanese) used by students
   in the journals and interviews was used to measure their linguistic
   self-confidence. The results suggested that students with high
   linguistic self-confidence perceive the videos used for the flipped
   class as beneficial for their learning but that they preferred to
   challenge themselves by reading the textbook without scaffolding from
   the videos. Students with medium and low linguistic self-confidence,
   however, indicated that they found the videos were beneficial for
   increasing their understanding of the content of the textbook and thus

Title = {Virtual Learning Contours in Students of Indian Higher Education
   Institutions},
Booktitle = {REIMAGINING BORDER IN CROSS-BORDER EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Pages = {284-313},
Abstract = {Higher education in India saw an abrupt shift from traditional face to
   face classrooms to complete online modes, given the strides made by our
   home country in the technological fronts and its integration with
   education, further catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic
   period, in particular, witnessed a proliferation in online learning in
   synchronous modes, contrary to the earlier existing asynchronous online
   modes. Though there exists replete literature discussing learner's
   readiness in the physical face to face classrooms and online learning
   readiness (OLR) for asynchronous modes, there is a dearth of similar
   literature for synchronous online modes.
   In its backdrop, we developed an online learning readiness scale for
   synchronous modes (OLRS SM) for students of Indian Higher Education
   Institutions (HEIs), following the approach by Armstrong et al., (2005)
   and Stein et al., (2007). OLRS SM assesses OLR for real-time online
   classes via Video Conferencing-based Learning Management Systems
   (VC-LMSs). The chapter further explores the factors of OLR which
   compromise the effectiveness of online learning. It also focuses on the
   consequences of the gender dynamics on the OLR of Indian students
   through the Mann-Whitney U test.
   The study reconfirms the resurfacing of gender-based stratification in
   online teaching-learning materialized through OLRS SM, which we
   acknowledge as the `virtual learning inequalities' (VLIs). Further, it
   brings to light a new concrete border shaped by the online educational
   system which is far beyond the existing understanding of the mere
   digital gap. This border resulting in `virtual learning hindrances'
   (VLHs) encompasses the factors related to learning preferences and
   motivation. We coin the term `virtual learning contours' (VLCs) in this
   chapter, a culmination of VLIs and VLHs. The study proposes diagnostic
   and remedial measures to bridge the VLCs. It also indicates the need to
   experiment with alternative teaching strategies so that resources can
   reach students.},

Abstract = {The widespread COVID-19 pandemic has not only posed a major health
   threat in Taiwan but also has challenged the nursing pedagogy. Both
   academia and the education industry are calling for a radical change of
   nursing pedagogy. Under such a call, the present study investigates an
   online collaborative knowledge co-construction mechanism-Crowdsourcing
   Collaborative Learning Strategy (CCLS)-to help student nurses acquire
   and practice functional knowledge on clinical operations targeted to the
   Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) at anytime and anywhere
   via the internet service. A t-test on the pre-and-post test between the
   control and experimental group explained the effectiveness of the CCLS
   online platform. Two questionnaires were used to explore students'
   perception of the effectiveness and the usefulness of the CCLS online
   platform. The findings suggested the CCLS online platform can help
   students to revisit their clinical performance via the recorded videos,
   facilitate student nurses' self-reflection on their performance, and
   help student nurses to minimize the academic-practice gap. Participants
   in this study scored the CCLS online platform as helpful and easy to use
   during the learning process.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the interpretation of principal components, many
   sparse principal component analysis (PCA) methods have been proposed by
   in the form of self-contained regression-type. In this paper, we
   generalize the steps needed to move from PCA-like methods to its
   self-contained regression-type, and propose a joint sparse pixel
   weighted PCA method. More specifically, we generalize a self-contained
   regression-type framework of graph embedding. Unlike the regression-type
   of graph embedding relying on the regular low-dimensional data, the
   self-contained regression-type framework does not rely on the regular
   low-dimensional data of graph embedding. The learned low-dimensional
   data in the form of self-contained regression theoretically approximates
   to the regular low-dimensional data. Under this self-contained
   regression-type, sparse regularization term can he arbitrarily added,
   and hence, the learned sparse regression coefficients can interpret the
   low-dimensional data. By using the joint sparse l(2,1)-norm regularizer,
   a sparse self-contained regression-type of pixel weighted PCA can be
   produced. Experiments on six data sets demonstrate that the proposed
   method is both feasible and effective.},

Abstract = {Immersive virtual reality (VR) is predicted to have a significant impact
   on education; but most studies investigating learning with immersive VR
   have reported mixed results when compared to low-immersion media. In
   this study, a sample of 118 participants was used to test whether a
   lesson presented in either immersive VR or as a video could benefit from
   the pre-training principle, as a means of reducing cognitive load.
   Participants were randomly assigned to one of two method conditions
   (with/without pre-training), and one of two media conditions (immersive
   VR/video). The results showed an interaction between media and method,
   indicating that pretraining had a positive effect on knowledge (d =
   0.81), transfer (d = 0.62), and self-efficacy (d = 0.64) directly
   following the intervention; and on self-efficacy (d = 0.84) in a
   one-week delayed post-test in the immersive VR condition. No effect was
   found for any of these variables within the video condition.},

Abstract = {Video saliency detection is intended to interpret the human visual
   system by modeling and predicting while observing a dynamic scene. This
   method is currently widely used in a variety of devices, including
   surveillance cameras and Internet-of-Things sensors. Traditionally, each
   video contains a large amount of redundancies in consecutive frames,
   while the common practices concentrate on extending the range of input
   frames to resist the uncertainty of input images. In order to overcome
   this problem, we propose Self-Adapted Frame Selection (SAFS) module that
   removes redundant information and selects frames that are highly
   informative. Furthermore, the module has high robustness and extensive
   application dealing with complex video contents, such as fast moving
   scene and images from different scenes. Since predicting the saliency
   map across multiple scenes is challenging, we establish a set of
   benchmarking videos for the scene change scenario. Specifically, our
   method combined with TASED-NET achieves significant improvements on the
   DHF1K dataset as well as the scene change dataset.},

Abstract = {An opportunity for a student to evaluate his or her own performance
   enhances self-awareness and promotes self-directed learning. Using three
   outcome measures of competency of procedure, communication skills, and
   learning motivation, the effects of self-evaluation using a video
   recording of the student's Foley catheterization was investigated in
   this study. The students in the experimental group (n = 20) evaluated
   their Foley catheterization performance by reviewing the video
   recordings of their own performance, whereas students in the control
   group (n = 20) received written evaluation guidelines only. The results
   showed that the students in the experimental group had better scores on
   competency (p < 0.001), communication skills (p < 0.001), and learning
   motivation (p = 0.018) than the control group at the posttest, which was
   conducted 8 weeks after the pretest. Self-awareness of one's own
   performance developed by reviewing a videotape appears to increase the

   the control group, on the other hand, only received face-to-face
   instruction.
   The results indicate that the experimental group reached a grade average
   (achievement) slightly superior (7.22) to that of the control group
   (6.81). A T-Student test carried out in order to determine the variance
   between averages, in this case for independent samples, reveals that
   there are no significant statistical variances between the averages of
   both groups. However, it is observed that the experimental group shows
   higher homogeneity, in other words, there is not too much dispersion,
   particularly towards the lower grades, as it does occur in the control
   group.
   This study has allowed to demonstrate that the teaching and learning
   process with a blended approach, which combines the development of
   academic activities delivered face-to-face, with the implementation of
   Moodle platform and the development of distance learning activities
   delivered through the use of the new tools of Web 2.0, made it possible
   for the students to learn new methods of communication and interaction,
   to acquire new self-learning techniques, to develop abilities to express
   with clarity and assertiveness. It generated in the students a more
   significant, participative and collaborative learning.},

Abstract = {This study was aimed to improve Chinese literary comprehension of the
   junior high school special needs students by reciting and singing Tang
   Dynasty poetry ( hereinafter called Tang poems) through YouTube videos
   to develop students' Chinese literary comprehension and to improve their
   retention defect by reciting and singing Tang poems in a special
   education classroom. Eight junior high school special needs students
   (aka students with learning disabilities) were engaged in this study.
   Students expressed inactive learning attitudes on classical Chinese
   before they changed to positive learning behavior in this study.
   Therefore, this study can offer teachers a better teaching strategy for
   helping special needs students to increase their self-confidence in
   obtaining Chinese literacy skills and build a vivid classroom

Abstract = {Introduction: The Oath of a Pharmacist (OAP) includes principles that
   help to direct the practice of pharmacy. The primary objective of this
   study was to evaluate which OAP components appealed the most to pharmacy
   students through self-generated video recordings. The secondary
   objective was to explore students' perceptions of this activity by
   retrieving their feedback about future video development considerations.
   Methods: First-year pharmacy students were invited by email to
   individually create a 1-min video that discussed an OAP tenet that
   resonated the most with them and why. The students were also asked: 1)
   If enhanced, would you use your video for self-promotion purposes? 2) Do
   you think this activity should be required or optional for future
   students? 3) What overall comments do you have about this activity? The
   study authors solely reviewed all submissions. Results: Twenty-nine
   students developed videos and submitted responses to the associated
   queries. All students stated they would utilize their videos for
   self-promotion purposes, if enhanced. Although most students supported
   the future use of this activity, they were roughly split about whether
   it should be required or optional. A Communications course was one of
   the curriculum locales suggested to house this activity. Conclusions:
   Pharmacy students video-recorded themselves articulating which OAP
   segment meant the most to them and why. Most students recommended
   embedding future iterations into the curriculum. This activity leveraged
   OAP aspects to learn more about students' personal and professional
   motivations.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has compelled practically all higher education
   institutions to adopt online education tools over the previous 2 years.
   Online education has a huge potential to supplement or take the place of
   in-person instruction. However, there are certain drawbacks of online
   learning, such as the absence of classroom environment interaction and
   the difficulty in keeping track of students' engagement and
   participation. In this study, a live virtual classroom was developed to
   aid students in their learning activities. The effectiveness of these
   live video classes was reported from both students and instructors, as
   well as the variables promoting their implementation within higher
   education institutions. One of the more significant findings to emerge
   from this study is that the instructors found it convenient, as they
   could readily check course participants understanding by studying their
   live video lectures. The second major finding was that students felt
   satisfaction with online learning while asking questions without
   interfering with the instructor's presentation. Moreover, peers could
   also provide them with more expertise. However, the teaching process
   became dynamic, requiring the educator to pay close attention. The
   course participants also experienced anxiety when they were in front of
   other people. Additionally, both the instructor and the students need to
   be highly self-sufficient in technology.},

Abstract = {Higher education in many disciplines has undergone a dramatic change
   with the incorporation of electronic means to enhance student learning.
   YouTube is an open-access online website that has gained tremendous
   popularity in recent years as it allows users to upload videos for
   social and educational purposes. The aim of this study was to assess
   whether dentally relevant videos would be utilized as a freely available
   tool to aid learning. Forty videos, mainly in the area of dental anatomy
   and local anesthesia, were uploaded and made available for a period of
   eighteen months from March 2012 to September 2013. The videos were
   watched a total of nearly 71,000 times, with the anatomy channels
   accounting for 58,000 views. Most of the viewers were from the United
   States and Australia, with an ever-increasing number of viewers from
   developing countries. This study suggests that YouTube can be used as an
   adjunct tool to supplement dental education due to it being easily
   accessible online. It provides many sources of information that can be
   accessed by those working in or preparing for the dental profession,
   whether students, practitioners, or those in geographically isolated

Title = {Multicourse Comparative Study of the Core Aspects for Flipped Learning:
   Investigating In-Class Structure and Student Use of Video Resources},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CHEMICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {97},
Number = {10},
Pages = {3490-3505},
Month = {OCT 13},
Abstract = {Since 2013, the number of publications on flipped learning within
   chemistry have steadily increased. However, most of these studies focus
   on flipped course reforms within individual institutions, while the
   outcomes of any learning environment are dependent on how the
   environment is structured and the degree to which students interact with
   its elements. In this study, we apply a coordinated set of assessment
   practices to investigate similarities among flipped chemistry courses at
   five institutions in the United States. All courses in the study
   followed the two basic tenets of flipped learning: (1) foundational
   information was delivered through preclass materials (PCMs), and (2) the
   face-to-face (F2F) environment applied or extended the content through
   active learning. Each F2F environment was characterized using video
   recordings analyzed with the Classroom Observation Protocol in
   Undergraduate STEM (COPUS) tool. Each individual course showed
   consistent use of F2F time across each session recording; however, there
   were significant differences in the predominant student behaviors
   between courses. Student behavior in two of the courses (Courses Four
   and Five) was dominated by work in small-groups on problem-solving
   worksheets, in contrast to another course (Course One) where responding
   to whole-class questioning posed by the instructor dominated students'
   behaviors. While behaviors in the two remaining courses (Courses Two and
   Three) included a mix of responding to clicker and whole-class
   questions, one of them (Course Three) also included large episodes of
   students simply listening during instructor presentation of material. A
   midsemester survey was administered in each course to characterize
   students' interactions with, and perceptions of, the PCMs. Of particular
   note, student self-reports of the number of videos viewed and the timing
   of viewing trended with the amount of peer-to-peer interaction during
   F2F sessions. That is, students in courses with more consistent
   group-work reported watching more of the video content and doing so
   before the F2F session. These results demonstrate that flipped
   classrooms can take many forms and suggest that F2F structure may create
   non-grade-based incentives for PCM utilization.},

Journal = {ANATOMICAL SCIENCES EDUCATION},
Year = {2016},
Volume = {9},
Number = {2},
Pages = {150-160},
Month = {MAR-APR},
Abstract = {Gross anatomy instruction in medical curricula involve a range of
   resources and activities including dissection, prosected specimens,
   anatomical models, radiological images, surface anatomy, textbooks,
   atlases, and computer-assisted learning (CAL). These resources and
   activities are underpinned by the expectation that students will
   actively engage in self-directed study (SDS) to enhance their knowledge
   and understanding of anatomy. To gain insight into preclinical versus
   clinical medical students' preferences for SDS resources for learning
   gross anatomy, and whether these vary on demographic characteristics and
   attitudes toward anatomy, students were surveyed at two Australian
   medical schools, one undergraduate-entry and the other graduate-entry.
   Lecture/tutorial/practical notes were ranked first by 33\% of 156
   respondents (mean rank +/- SD, 2.48 +/- 1.38), textbooks by 26\% (2.62
   +/- 1.35), atlases 20\% (2.80 +/- 1.44), videos 10\% (4.34 +/- 1.68),
   software 5\% (4.78 +/- 1.50), and websites 4\% (4.24 +/- 1.34). Among
   CAL resources, Wikipedia was ranked highest. The most important factor
   in selecting CAL resources was cost (ranked first by 46\%), followed by
   self-assessment, ease of use, alignment with curriculum, and excellent
   graphics (each 6-9\%). Compared with preclinical students, clinical
   students ranked software and Acland's Video Atlas of Human Anatomy
   higher and felt radiological images were more important in selecting CAL
   resources. Along with other studies reporting on the quality, features,
   and impact on learning of CAL resources, the diversity of students'
   preferences and opinions on usefulness and ease of use reported here can
   help guide faculty in selecting and recommending a range of CAL and
   other resources to their students to support their self-directed study.

Abstract = {Introduction: Current computerised self-learning (SL) stations for Basic
   Life Support (BLS) are an alternative to instructor-led (IL) refresher
   training but are not intended for initial skill acquisition. We
   developed a SL station for initial skill acquisition and evaluated its
   efficacy.
   Methods: In a non-inferiority trial, 120 pharmacy students were
   randomised to IL small group training or individual training in a SL
   station. In the IL group, instructors demonstrated the skills and
   provided feedback. In the SL group a shortened Mini Anne (TM) video, to
   acquire the skills, was followed by Resusci Anne Skills Station (TM)
   software (both Laerdal, Norway) with voice feedback for further
   refinement. Testing was performed individually, respecting a seven week
   interval after training for every student.
   Results: One hundred and seventeen participants were assessed (three
   drop-outs). The proportion of students achieving a mean compression
   depth 40-50mm was 24/56 (43\%) IL vs. 31/61 (51\%) SL and 39/56 (70\%)
   IL vs. 48/61 (79\%) SL for a mean compression depth >40mm. Compression
   rate 80-120/min was achieved in 49/56 (88\%) IL vs. 57/61 (93\%) SL and
   any incomplete release (>= 5mm) was observed in 31/56 (55\%) IL and
   35/61 (57\%) SL. Adequate mean ventilation volume (400-1000 ml) was
   achieved in 29/56 (52\%) IL vs. 36/61 (59\%) SL. Non-inferiority was
   confirmed for depth and although inconclusive, other areas came close to
   demonstrate it.
   Conclusions: Compression skills acquired in a SL station combining
   video-instruction with training using voice feedback were not inferior
   to IL training. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The present study assessed the effectiveness of video-based tutorials
   for software training in which three practice schedules (i.e., blocked,
   interleaved and hybrid) were systematically varied. Forty-nine
   participants studied the video tutorials and engaged in task practice to
   learn advanced formatting tasks for Word. The conditions were compared
   for processing of the videos and effectiveness judgments. Also,
   self-efficacy and knowledge development were assessed. No effect of
   practice schedule was found on video processing measures (i.e., total
   time, unique play time, replays). Self-efficacy development was positive
   and significant. For untrained items this development favoured the
   hybrid over the interleaved practice schedule. Effectiveness judgments
   were favourable and similar for the three conditions. Both conceptual
   and procedural knowledge development (during and after training) was
   significant. No effect of practice schedule on these developments was
   found.},

Abstract = {Student engagement and retention is a major challenge in the STEM
   (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) introductory large
   enrollment college classrooms. Incoming students, categorized as
   millennial or digital learners, often see no appeal to traditional
   lecture formats or learning materials such as text-books and are often
   un-motivated to use these materials when learning or studying. As a
   result, digital games are increasing in popularity due to their
   potential to facilitate learning by increasing student motivation and
   engagement. Research has shown that educational digital games enhance
   student self-efficacy, motivation, and performance by providing
   immediate encouragement, praise, and reinforcement to the student. At
   the same time, well designed digital games work to actively engage
   students by immersing them in a virtual world, in which they are center
   stage and their choices have a noticeable impact on the gaming
   environment. The implementation of gamified learning overlaps well with
   the blended learning model, which has proved to be an effective method
   of facilitating the expansion of student-centered approaches in large
   enrollment courses. In alignment with the current literature on
   millennial learners, gamification, and the blended learning approach, we
   designed a digital educational experience based on a board game that was
   developed in the 1970's to introduce students to several key ecology and
   evolution concepts. In this role-playing video game, players take on the
   characteristics of a species living on the island of ``Darwinia.{''} The
   goal is to outcompete other species on the island for habitat resources
   and avoid extinction. The game demonstrates the basic mechanics of
   population ecology and natural selection in an interactive manner that
   helps students understand and revisit difficult concepts in ecology and
   evolution. A series of questions set up as an accompanying class module
   prompt students to compare their game play to real-life biology
   mechanisms. The blended approach of video game and in-class activity
   facilitates students' extension of content, encouraging students to
   think critically and link several biological concepts together. The
   target population is introductory biology students enrolled in two
   learning formats: traditional lecture and collaborative,
   student-centered. A Likert-style motivation survey based on the
   intrinsic motivation inventory will be used to assess student motivation
   and interest in the game. In addition, an open ended survey will be
   given to capture student perceptions of usability and usefulness, as
   well as their willingness to play the game as a means of learning course
   material.},

Abstract = {Presentation feedback can be limited in its feed-forward value, as
   students do not have their actual presentation available for review
   whilst reflecting upon the feedback. This study reports on students'
   perceptions of the learning and feed-forward value of an oral
   presentation assessment. Students self-marked their performance
   immediately after their presentation, after reviewing a video recording
   of their presentation and wrote a reflection relating to their
   experience. Survey data revealed that most students viewed all aspects
   of the assessment task positively and they rated the process as
   providing substantial learning value. They also indicated that the video
   review and overall assessment exercise provided valuable feed-forward
   information that would assist them to improve future presentations.
   These data were further supported by content analysis of the qualitative
   data. Students noted that they perceived the video review task as
   self-enabling. They also noted that the self-reflection and self-marking
   exercise provided time for thought although it was personally
   challenging. Therefore, via carefully designed assessment, it is
   possible to provide a deep learning opportunity from oral presentations
   that can feed-forward to enhance students' future presentations.},

Abstract = {Recent research has shown a growing interest in myths about teaching and
   learning and their prevalence among different populations. However,
   little is known about the extent to which these myths are prevalent
   among high school students. Future research must focus on methods that
   best support dispelling these myths to promote high school students in
   terms of knowledge security, recognition of fake news, and critical
   thinking, to foster their acquisition of competencies and to implement
   conceptual change. In the field of natural sciences, studies have shown
   that the use of learning videos can be an effective method to provoke
   conceptual change. For this purpose, two versions of a digital learning
   video (interactive {[}N = 36] vs. not interactive {[}N = 35]) have been
   developed to help high school students overcome five common and widely
   distributed myths (e.g., the learning style myth). The aim of our study
   was to analyze whether educational videos in an educational psychology
   context, in this case, neuromyths, can also lead to conceptual change.
   Furthermore, we wanted to know what role the degree of interactivity of
   the learning video plays in this. Results reveal that the interventions
   lead to a reduction of beliefs in myths, but only for those myths that
   were presented within the interventions. Results also reveal that the
   interactivity of the video did not make a difference in whether students
   believed in myths or not.},

Abstract = {In this study, we present experimental evidence that observational
   learning is a powerful learning tool in academic writing education.
   Using a quasi pre- and post-test experimental/control group design we
   tested three effects of observational learning with first year
   university students (N=144). Both the students from the observational
   (N=72) and the control group (N=72) were given pre- and post-tests to
   benchmark and evaluate the accuracy of their self-efficacy beliefs, task
   knowledge and writing skills. The intervention consisted of three 1-hour
   sessions in which they learned how to write up a literature review, a
   genre that was unknown to them. The control group practiced the new text
   genre by four short and one longer writing exercise. The participants in
   the experimental setting did not complete any writing exercise during
   the writing course. Instead, the), observed pairs of video-based peer
   models who were performing the last writing exercise of the control
   group. The results demonstrate that (1) observational learning had a
   more positive effect on the students' self-perceptions of their writing
   performances in the observational group than in the control group; (2)
   observational learning enlarged students' knowledge about how to write
   up a good summary from different sources; and (3) observational learning
   was effective for a complex writing task, such as the literature review:
   the experimental group linked the source material more often and wrote
   summaries with a better overall organization compared to the control
   group.},

Month = {MAR 26},
Abstract = {Contemporary theories of learning and instruction as well as a large
   body of research have pinpointed the benefits of effective
   self-regulated learning (SRL) for students' academic achievements, yet
   research findings indicate that teachers' actual promotion of students'
   SRL strategies and students' actual use of such strategies are less
   common than expected. To extend the investigation of how and when
   teachers' expertise develops regarding SRL instruction practices in
   authentic classrooms, the current study compared preservice vs.
   inservice teachers' ``noticing{''} of explicit SRL teaching behaviors in
   videotaped classroom vignettes. Preservice teachers in a university
   teacher training program (N = 296) and inservice elementary, junior
   high, and high school teachers (N = 305) were presented with six online
   video cases accompanied by questions about the videotaped teachers'
   instruction of SRL planning, monitoring, and evaluation strategies. The
   results suggested that, overall, both preservice and inservice teachers
   failed to notice the expert teachers' explicit SRL teaching.
   Furthermore, their noticing ability failed to increase over the career
   span, with growing teaching experience. Thus, targeted instruction is
   recommended during both preservice training and inservice development
   programs to promote all teachers' application of evidence-based explicit
   SRL teaching strategies.},

Abstract = {Educational institutions today are embracing technology to enhance
   education quality through intelligent systems. This study introduces an
   innovative strategy to boost the performance of such procedures by
   seamlessly integrating machine learning on edge devices and cloud
   infrastructure. The proposed framework harnesses the capabilities of a
   Hybrid 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory
   Network (LSTM) architecture, offering profound insights into intelligent
   education. Operating at the crossroads of localised and centralised
   analyses, the Hybrid 1D CNN-LSTM architecture signifies a significant
   advancement. It directly engages edge devices used by students and
   educators, laying the groundwork for personalised learning experiences.
   This architecture adeptly captures the intricacies of various
   modalities, including text, images, and videos, by harmonising 1D CNN
   layers and LSTM modules. This approach facilitates the extraction of
   tailored features from each modality and the exploration of temporal
   intricacies. Consequently, the architecture provides a holistic
   comprehension of student engagement and comprehension dynamics,
   unveiling individual learning preferences. Moreover, the framework
   seamlessly integrates data from edge devices into the cloud
   infrastructure, allowing insights from both domains to merge. Educators
   benefit from attention-enhanced feature maps that encapsulate
   personalised insights, empowering them to customise content and
   strategies according to student learning preferences. The approach
   bridges real-time, localised analysis with comprehensive cloud-mediated
   insights, paving the path for transformative educational experiences.
   Empirical validation reinforces the effectiveness of the Hybrid 1D
   CNN-LSTM architecture, cementing its potential to revolutionise
   intelligent education within academic institutions. This fusion of
   machine learning across edge devices and cloud architecture can reshape
   the educational landscape, ushering in a more innovative and more
   responsive learning environment that caters to the diverse needs of
   students and educators alike.},

Title = {Teaching Programming by Revealing Thinking Process: Watching Experts'
   Live Coding Videos With Reflection Annotations},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {65},
Number = {4},
Pages = {617-627},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Contribution: Programming is a complex cognitive activity that involves
   both conceptual understanding and procedural skills, which is
   challenging for novices. To develop both program comprehension and
   implementation competency, this study proposed a live-coding-based
   instruction. Experts' live coding with think-aloud was recorded.
   Students then learn algorithmic planning and coding skills by observing
   experts' thinking and coding processes from the videos. To deploy this
   pedagogical strategy, a learning platform was developed to present the
   videos to students who could also annotate their reflection about the
   videos in the system to deepen their understanding of syntax and
   concepts of computer programming. Background: Traditional lecture-based
   programming instruction focuses more on the explanation of syntax and
   concepts but lacks revealing the dynamic and nonlinear thinking and
   coding process. Research Questions: This study is to explore the effects
   of live-coding-based instruction on students' programming knowledge,
   including declarative program knowledge (program comprehension) and
   procedural program knowledge (coding skills), and whether the
   instruction changes their attitude toward programming learning or not.
   Methodology: An empirical study was conducted with 33 high-school
   students who were novice programmers in one semester to explore the
   effectiveness of the live-coding-based instruction and the use of the
   learning platform. Findings: The experiment results show that watching
   flowcharting (r=0.369, p <0.05) or coding processes (r=0.409, p <0.05)
   of experts improves coding skills. This implies that explicit depiction
   of algorithmic planning and coding processes are essential for building
   procedural programming knowledge. In addition, reflection on syntactic
   content of experts' programming plays an important role in programming
   (r=0.511,p <0.01). The research findings suggest that programming
   instruction could focus more on developing students' problem-solving
   abilities by demonstrating the dynamic and nonlinear programming
   processes and providing opportunities for students to reflect on how
   syntactic knowledge could be applied to programming.},

Abstract = {This study explored the use of video-annotated peer feedback in
   supporting student learning in oral presentation lessons. Nine student
   volunteers from one of the polytechnics in Malaysia participated in
   three rounds of video-annotated peer feedback sessions to improve their
   oral presentation skills. Even though video-annotated peer feedback was
   found to focus primarily on `structure' and `body language', most of the
   feedback were specific and cognitive feedback consisting of summary
   comments, problem/strength identification, solution and explanatory
   comments were identified. Collectively, students perceived the use of
   video-annotated peer feedback positively in their learning. The
   prominent themes emerging from the analysis of students' journal
   entries: students' active engagement in creative problem-solving,
   enhanced understanding of weaknesses in doing oral presentation and
   students' self-reflection seem to confirm the potential pedagogical
   benefits of using this approach in teaching of oral presentation.},

   evaluate the effectiveness of a video self-modeling (VSM) intervention
   to teach classroom rules to two children with Asperger's. Results
   indicated that each of the children improved in their ability to recite
   classroom rules following the VSM intervention. These results were
   maintained for both students at 12 weeks post-intervention. The findings
   of this study suggest that VSM is an effective tool for teaching

Title = {Multi-Granular Semantic Analysis Based on Nasal Endoscopic Video},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {158317-158326},
Abstract = {The semantic analysis of nasal endoscopic video is a challenging task
   since lots of irrelevant and insignificant information exists in the
   untrimmed surgical video, i.e. background, blur, judder or blood-stained
   video fragments. It is important to identify the start and end point of
   the valid surgical fragments automatically and remove the invalid
   fragments of endoscopic surgery videos for medical education \&
   research. However, the performance of deep-learning based methods, which
   use a fixed time interval and a sliding window, are severely affected
   when the interference information appears randomly in the nasal
   endoscopic video. Specifically, the surgical video is a continuous
   process globally, while many local discontinuity fragments are brought
   when endoscope enters and exits the cavity frequently. Hence, we propose
   a multi-granularity semantic analysis framework that can simultaneously
   meet the accuracy and timeliness required for endoscopic surgery video
   semantic analysis. Our approach is an end-to-end solution. First, a
   joint model is created to extract the temporal-spatial features of the
   surgical video on a coarse-grained scale. Meanwhile, an attention
   mechanism is used to automatically select the informative spatial
   features of endoscopic video. Second, a hierarchical self-correction
   module is proposed to correct the boundaries of the surgical operation
   iteratively on a fine-grained scale. Finally, we justify the proposed
   network through extensive experiments and quantitative comparisons
   against other state-of-the-art approaches. We achieve a good performance
   in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

Abstract = {Research has shown learning advantages for self-controlled practice
   contexts relative to yoked (i.e., experimenter-imposed) contexts; yet,
   explanations for this phenomenon remain relatively untested. We
   examined, via path analysis, whether self-efficacy and intrinsic
   motivation are important constructs for explaining self-controlled
   learning benefits. The path model was created using theory-based and
   empirically supported relationships to examine causal links between
   these psychological constructs and physical performance. We hypothesised
   that self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation would have greater
   predictive power for learning under self-controlled compared to yoked
   conditions. Participants learned double-mini trampoline progressions,
   and measures of physical performance, self-efficacy and intrinsic
   motivation were collected over two practice days and a delayed retention
   day. The self-controlled group (M=2.04, SD=.98) completed significantly
   more skill progressions in retention than their yoked counterparts
   (M=1.3, SD=.65). The path model displayed adequate fit, and similar
   significant path coefficients were found for both groups wherein each
   variable was predominantly predicted by its preceding time point (e.g.,
   self-efficacy time 1 predicts self-efficacy time 2). Interestingly, the
   model was not moderated by group; thus, failing to support the
   hypothesis that self-efficacy and intrinsic motivation have greater
   predictive power for learning under self-controlled relative to yoked
   conditions.},

Abstract = {Increasing and compelling research demonstrates the affordances of
   personal video footage as an informative and transformational tool in
   teacher professional learning (PL), yet many in-service teachers avoid
   engaging in this practice. This Australian Research Council funded study
   tracked teacher willingness to use video to capture the application of
   PL over 12 months in a rural Australian primary school. Data from
   questionnaires, video-based learning conversations, and collaborative
   sharing sessions demonstrated a strong increasing trend in the number of
   teachers volunteering to be videoed across three iterations of research.
   Thematic analysis highlighted five key factors as catalysts for
   increased teacher participation in engaging with video as a professional
   learning (PL) tool. These factors include - safe relationships and the
   building of relational trust; personalized connection of PL to classroom
   practice; an effective video annotation repository system; teacher
   agency within an iterative structure; and time - the need for external
   support systems. This study found that when these factors were
   addressed, willingness to engage in using the power of video as a tool
   to support teacher PL increased.},

Abstract = {Currently, kindergarten education is shaped by two priorities: (1) the
   recognition that early learning must maintain a developmental
   orientation and support socio-personal growth; and (2) a growing
   emphasis on standards-based curriculum and the use of assessment to
   support children's learning. While some researchers have argued these
   two priorities are counter-related, research demonstrates the potential
   to embed these goals through play-based pedagogies. The purpose of this
   paper is to explore how kindergarten teachers leverage assessment
   practices, particularly Assessment as Learning (AaL), to support
   children learning within play-based classrooms. Centrally, we argue that
   a focus on AaL and self-regulation might be the fulcrum that hinges
   play-pedagogies with standards-based education and assessment mandates,
   helping to diminish the divide between these two priorities. Data are
   drawn from 20 kindergarten classrooms via initial interviews,
   observations and video-elicitation teacher interviews. Findings identify
   how kindergarten teachers are productively using assessment to promote
   learner independence within play-based classrooms.},

Abstract = {Background: In the American Association of Colleges of Nursing's updated
   Essentials, competency-based education (CBE) is the expected standard
   for nursing curricula. CBE approaches include observation, practice
   repetition, demonstration, and video supervision guided by a framework
   of competency, feedback, and self-reflection. Method: The promotion of
   skills competency among nursing students was facilitated by
   self-regulated learning using video skills-based competency testing.
   Video surveillance enabled students to practice and self-test their
   competency skills. Results: Self-videotaping by students provided a
   comfortable learning environment for repeated practice and fostered
   clinical judgment and accountability. Students reported increased
   confidence, decreased anxiety, and improved performance. Students
   developed skills and attitudes regarding self-reflection and
   self-remediation. Additionally, faculty reported improved visibility, a
   more efficient workload, and greater achievement of student outcomes.
   Conclusion: Integrating CBE and incorporating video technology during
   skills testing enhances the opportunity for students to demonstrate
   skills competency and gain comfort in their own skills acquisition. {[}J

Title = {Individuals in a group: Metacognitive and regulatory predictors of
   learning achievement in collaborative learning},
Journal = {LEARNING AND INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {96},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Self-regulated learning theory acknowledges the importance of an
   individual's metacognitive monitoring and group-level regulation for
   learning achievement in collaborative learning. However, very few
   studies have empirically investigated the interplay of these factors.
   This study aimed to investigate how groups' metacognitive interactions,
   group-level regulation, and individuals' metacognitive monitoring
   accuracy together predict students' learning achievement. Thirty groups
   of secondary school students (n = 94) attended a five-week physics
   course involving four 90-min lessons. Each lesson included a
   collaborative learning session in which the students solved physics
   problems in groups of three. After each session, the students filled out
   a quiz that evaluated their learning of the core concepts related to
   each lesson. The students' collaborative learning was video-recorded
   using 360-degree cameras. First, the groups' metacognitive interaction,
   co-regulation (CoRL), and socially shared regulation (SSRL) during
   collaborative learning were coded from the video data. Second, the
   students' metacognitive monitoring accuracy was determined in relation
   to quizzes presented at the end of each collaborative session. Each
   student's learning achievement was assessed at the end of the course
   with an individual written exam. Bayesian multilevel models were used to
   analyze the nested data. The results showed that the frequency of
   metacognitive interaction was positively related to learning
   achievement. However, the relation between CoRL and learning achievement
   was moderated by monitoring accuracy and metacognitive interaction. The
   relation between CoRL and achievement was positive when coupled with a
   high frequency of metacognitive interactions but negative under a low
   frequency of metacognitive interactions. In addition, in line with
   theory, the students with lower monitoring accuracy achieved higher
   learning when CoRL was frequent in a group. Due to the low occurrence of
   SSRL, its relation with learning achievement could not be analyzed. No
   reliable evidence for the relation between monitoring accuracy and
   learning achievement was found. The results highlighted the complex
   interplay of individual-and group-level factors related to collaborative
   learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {The integration of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) in
   education has enhanced the power of teaching and learning process. ICTs
   have been used to deliver learning material through many tools such as
   email, blogs, YouTube, wiki, discussion boards, and others online
   application. Education dominantly uses computer technology to encourage
   innovation in teaching such as Computer Assisted Instructional (CAI).
   Computers can also be used to provide distance education for
   facilitating online learning and interaction. They are given the chance
   to learn through computer-based instruction schemes. Some experts and
   practitioners of education in language teaching have created the
   Computer Assisted Language Learning (CALL) that strongly supports the
   utilization of ICT in language learning. This tool is flexible, rich and
   interactive in the term of time and place and in term of encouraging
   students in learning language at their own pace. This is due to the
   computer's ability to present learning materials which has more diverse
   ways than either a book or video does. In addition, it is able to
   generate online interaction and improve communicative competence,
   including providing authentic material to the distance language learning
   environment and for self-directed learning. This paper will discuss
   about how to utilize all of these ICTs' abilities as the basic
   facilities to create IT-based learning materials for supporting distance
   language teaching and learning.},

Abstract = {Introduction: The education and training of employees in public health
   care institutions is conducted in accordance with the regulations on
   education and financial possibilities of institutions. The article
   presents motives for and barriers to the education of the physicians,
   nurses, laboratory and support services personnel.
   Methods: The quantitative survey method was used.
   Results: In all occupational groups the main motivational reasons for
   education are the opportunities for the improvement of work processes,
   personal development and greater confidence at work, while lack of time
   is the key obstacle to the education of employees. All occupational
   groups agreed that education during working hours is a greater barrier
   than education outside working hours. The employees would like more
   short training programmes in their workplace.
   Discussion: The results of the survey lead to new forms of education.
   Education and training should be promoted by alternative forms of
   learning (e-learning, the use of audio and video media, learning in
   small informal groups, etc.). Role-play and educational films help build
   teams, increase employee motivation, improve communication and encourage
   training and learning development.
   Conclusion: With the new forms of education and training we can
   rationalise educational processes and motivate employees to engage it
   self-learning and to transfer their knowledge to others.},

Abstract = {Gamification is an umbrella term, meaning the implementation of video
   game elements in a non-video game environment in order to improve the
   user experience and increase the user's motivation and engagement {[}1].
   When gamification is applied to education, it refers to `making learning
   experiences more engaging and game-like by using game design elements
   and game mechanics' {[}2]. Pupils' motivation is one of the most
   important factors in the learning process {[}3]-{[}7], and games
   characteristically possess a high level of motivational potential {[}2],
   {[}8]-{[}11]. Although previous studies have shown that the use of game
   elements may promote the desired user behaviour in different fields,
   some warn that it can decrease intrinsic motivation {[}12].
   Grounded in a self-determination theory (SDT) framework {[}13], {[}14],
   this study intends to understand the effect that playing an educational
   mobile game can have in stimulating pupils to engage in learning about
   recycling. The study focuses on students in early secondary education
   within the age group between 12-14 years.
   In order to understand children's motivation before and after they play
   an educational mobile game about recycling, pupils were asked to respond
   to a motivation scale survey. The Situational Motivation Scale (SIMS) is
   a 16-item measure of the self-determination of a person's choice to
   participate in an activity {[}15], {[}16]. Situational motivation refers
   to the motivation individuals experience when they are currently
   engaging in an activity.
   The sample of this study was formed by 36 children in Portugal and in
   the UK (PT=20, UK=16). Findings show that the children's intrinsic
   motivation scores increased over 10\% after playing the recycling game.
   Although Identified Regulation (participating in an activity because the
   students value its outcomes) also increased 6\%, this result show that
   the effects of playing the game on this type of extrinsic motivation
   were not so large comparing to intrinsic motivation. Regarding the
   external regulation, there was an increase of 0.5\% and, lastly,
   amotivation scores decreased by 17,1\%. These overall results seem to
   show an increase of the effect along the autonomy continuum, describing
   the extent to which pupils have been internalized and integrated into
   the activity. Although the findings regarding the two countries do not
   differ much, it is possible to observe that the Portuguese pupils were
   more highly motivated while they played the educational game, but the
   effect of playing the game was higher on the UK pupils' motivation.
   These overall results suggest that playing a mobile game could increase
   the intrinsic motivation and, therefore, decrease pupils' amotivation,
   while having a small effect on students' extrinsic motivation. Hence,
   gamification could be a useful tool in the classroom for this age group
   of children.},

Pages = {393-398},

Abstract = {Objective: We examined the effects of presentation medium on immediate
   and delayed recall of information and assessed the effect of giving
   patients take-home materials after initial presentations.
   Methods: Primary-care patients received video-based, print-based or no
   asthma education about asthma symptoms and triggers and then answered
   knowledge-based questions. Print participants and half the video
   participants received take-home print materials. A week later, available
   participants completed the knowledge assessment again.
   Results: Participants receiving either intervention outperformed
   controls on immediate and delayed assessments (p < 0.001). For
   symptom-related information, immediate performance did not significantly
   differ between print and video participants. A week later, receiving
   take-home print predicted better performance (p < 0.05), as did
   self-reported review among recipients of take-home print (p < 0.01). For
   content about inhaler usage, although video watchers outperformed print
   participants immediately after seeing the materials (p < 0.001), a week
   later these two groups' performance did not significantly differ. Among
   participants given take-home materials, review predicted marginally
   better recall (p = 0.06).
   Conclusion: Video and print interventions can promote recall of
   health-related information. Additionally, reviewable materials, if they
   are utilized, may improve retention. Practice implications: When
   creating educational tools, providers should consider how long
   information must be retained, its content, and the feasibility of
   providing tangible supporting materials. (C) 2010 Published by Elsevier

Abstract = {The application of the best practices of teaching adults to the
   education of adults in medical education settings is important in the
   process of transforming learners to become and remain effective
   physicians. Medical education at all levels should be designed to equip
   physicians with the knowledge, clinical skills, and professionalism that
   are required to deliver quality patient care. The ultimate outcome is
   the health of the patient and the health status of the society. In the
   translational science of medical education, improved patient outcomes
   linked directly to educational events are the ultimate goal and are best
   defined by rigorous medical education research efforts. To best develop
   faculty, the same principles of adult education and teaching adults
   apply. In a systematic review of faculty development initiatives
   designed to improve teaching effectiveness in medical education, the use
   of experiential learning, feedback, effective relationships with peers,
   and diverse educational methods were found to be most important in the
   success of these programs. In this article, we present 5 examples of
   applying the best practices in teaching adults and utilizing the
   emerging understanding of the neurobiology of learning in teaching
   students, trainees, and practitioners. These include (1) use of
   standardized patients to develop communication skills, (2) use of online
   quizzes to assess knowledge and aid self-directed learning, (3) use of
   practice sessions and video clips to enhance significant learning of
   teaching skills, (4) use of case-based discussions to develop
   professionalism concepts and skills, and (5) use of the American Academy
   of Pediatrics PediaLink as a model for individualized learner-directed
   online learning. These examples highlight how experiential leaning,
   providing valuable feedback, opportunities for practice, and stimulation
   of self-directed learning can be utilized as medical education continues
   its dynamic transformation in the years ahead.},

Journal = {COGENT EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},

Number = {2},
Month = {DEC 11},
Abstract = {By the beginning of 2020, there were widespread school closures caused
   by the spread of coronavirus for an unknown duration. Consequently, many
   schools turned to online learning using a software application, or a
   video conferencing system. As high levels of self-directed learning
   (SDL) are important for the quality of online learning, the present
   study aimed to understand learner SDL in an online environment and
   identify its challenges and barriers at one of the higher education
   institutes in Oman. It addressed a case study that documented how
   learning went in three online courses and reported perceptions of
   learners pertaining to effective SDL. Data were collected through
   interviews with seven selected students from each course, virtual
   observations of online teaching, and course documents. Results revealed
   four issues related to students' SDL in online classes: 1) student
   cognitive engagement with online learning, 2) student-centered approach,
   3) time-management and 4) student emotional engagement with online
   learning. The findings suggest a need to design an effective online
   learning environment through reinforcing students' satisfaction and
   motivation in online classes, their time management skill, a
   student-centered approach and teacher presence.},

Abstract = {This paper presents an experimental study of long-term re-identification
   of honeybees from the appearance of their abdomen in videos. The first
   contribution is composed of two image datasets of single honeybees
   extracted from 12 days of video and annotated with information about
   their identity on long-term and short-term scales. The long-term dataset
   contains 8,962 images associated to 181 known identities and used to
   evaluate the long-term re-identification of individuals. The short-term
   dataset contains 109,654 images associated to 4,949 short-term tracks
   that provide multiple views of an individual suitable for
   self-supervised training A deep convolutional network was trained to map
   an image of the honeybee's abdomen to a 128 dimensional feature vector
   using several approaches. Re-identification was evaluated in test setups
   that capture different levels of difficulty: from the same hour to a
   different day. The results show using the short-term self-supervised
   information for training performed better than the supervised long-term
   dataset, with best performance achieved by using both. Ablation studies
   show the impact of the quantity of data used in training as well as the
   impact of augmentation, which will guide the design of future systems
   for individual identification.},

Title = {TTVFI: Learning Trajectory-Aware Transformer for Video Frame
   Interpolation},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON IMAGE PROCESSING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {32},
Pages = {4728-4741},
Abstract = {Video frame interpolation (VFI) aims to synthesize an intermediate frame
   between two consecutive frames. State-of-the-art approaches usually
   adopt a two-step solution, which includes 1) generating locally-warped
   pixels by calculating the optical flow based on pre-defined motion
   patterns (e.g., uniform motion, symmetric motion), 2) blending the
   warped pixels to form a full frame through deep neural synthesis
   networks. However, for various complicated motions (e.g., non-uniform
   motion, turn around), such improper assumptions about pre-defined motion
   patterns introduce the inconsistent warping from the two consecutive
   frames. This leads to the warped features for new frames are usually not
   aligned, yielding distortion and blur, especially when large and complex
   motions occur. To solve this issue, in this paper we propose a novel
   Trajectory-aware Transformer for Video Frame Interpolation (TTVFI). In
   particular, we formulate the warped features with inconsistent motions
   as query tokens, and formulate relevant regions in a motion trajectory
   from two original consecutive frames into keys and values.
   Self-attention is learned on relevant tokens along the trajectory to
   blend the pristine features into intermediate frames through end-to-end
   training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
   other state-of-the-art methods in four widely-used VFI benchmarks. Both
   code and pre-trained models will be released at

Title = {Seeking the best blend for deep learning in a flipped classroom -
   viewing student perceptions through the Community of Inquiry lens},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {15},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {We describe a case study of a third-year undergraduate class in
   Enterprise Education. A blended learning design in the form of a flipped
   classroom with a duration of one semester, was explored in two cohorts.
   The question was to explore how students experienced the flipped class
   for learning and how this approach presented the different presences in
   the Community of Inquiry (CoI), and its revisions. The online learning
   components represented the individual learning space, where the main
   resource was bespoke videos that replaced lectures and complemented the
   textbook and other learning material. The classroom hosted a business
   school-style seminar where students in small groups engaged in solving a
   new business case study, going through phases of developing a concept to
   presenting the group solutions to the class. It aimed at fostering
   active learning both inside and outside the class. Students participated
   in the activities to apply the theory in new cases. The teacher
   facilitated the sessions, provided direction and correction as needed.
   The research used mixed methods consisting of trace data, quantitative
   and qualitative student feedback to explore how suitable the flipped
   classroom in undergraduate education was towards developing deep
   learning. The online individual learning space yielded highly salient
   Teaching Presences, accompanied by evidence of Agency Presence,
   characterised by independent activity and personal learning preferences.
   Online videos and ICT resources helped with understanding the theory
   ahead of class meetings. Seminars in the collaborative space fostered
   deep learning of the theory, and enabled students to apply the prepared
   theory in case studies and solve problems. Integration and particularly
   Resolution in Cognitive Presence of CoI featured in the seminars, while
   Social Presence was the weakest. Suggestions are made to implement the
   flipped class principles in an online class.},

Title = {Emergent Narratives in Remote Learning Experiences for Project Based

Abstract = {The University of Naples Federico II (Italy) offers a nine-month
   formative training program aimed at software development for the Apple
   technology ecosystem to (similar to)400 learners per year and utilises
   the Challenge Based Learning (CBL) methodology as a framework for
   learning. As a collaborative and self-guided, inquiry-based learning
   method, it focuses on learners' intrinsic motivation while working on
   real world problems organised in projects (Challenges in CBL) with an
   experiential and progressive approach to apply acquired knowledge in
   real world scenarios, ideate solution concepts and build innovative
   digital products. To overcome limitations of spiral curriculum or
   elaboration theory, the authors applied narrative theory to design the
   program's educational experience for the academic year 2019/2020 as a
   cohesive journey within a communal learning environment with a coherent
   and connected structure of narratively driven learning Challenges. The
   authors present concepts to develop their approach further towards an
   emergent narrative experience design system to manage the educational
   journey as it develops, rather than scripting it. This paper evolves the
   authors' Narrative Experience Design Canvas to model educational
   experience design that encourages unscripted, emergent narratives for
   experiential education with the goal of fostering learners' engagement,
   agency and creativity. Derived in part by models developed for digital
   interactive storytelling or educational video games, it categorises the
   components for designing an educational experience that allows the
   learning progression to be driven by learners as co-authors and
   describes mechanisms that allow unscripted narratives to emerge based on
   intrinsic motivation. Additionally, the authors present considerations
   for synchronous and asynchronous learning to evolve their framework for
   application in blended or remote learning scenarios. Drawing upon
   findings for remote learning and experiential e-learning - ee-learning -
   presented by scholars as well as implications identified during the
   COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting switch to remote learning within the
   program at University of Naples Federico II in 2020, it is shown how
   combining narrative elements with experiential e-learning principles can
   result in increased engagement, motivation and sense of community in
   learners. Using the example of an individual learning unit - a Challenge
   - considerations from overall course design down to day-to-day learning
   activities within the course are presented. For the future, the authors
   indicate action points to develop this model into an Emergent Narrative
   System for designing narratively driven and experiential software
   development education programs and indicate areas of further research on
   learning activity design for blended or remote learning experiences.},

Abstract = {Background: Video games are interactive technologies able to support
   children in health promotion, behavior changes, and chronic disease
   self-management. The use of health behavior change determinants in video
   game design can increase its effectiveness. This study describes the
   process of designing a video game for Brazilian children with T1D
   clarifying the use of health behavior change determinants that may
   influence self-management behaviors.
   Methods: This was a methodological study based on health behavior change
   theories and the user-centered design approach. The results of a
   qualitative study conducted with children aged 7 to 12years identified
   learning needs about knowledge on diabetes and self-care tasks which
   contribute to inappropriate behaviors. A Behavioral Diagnosis presented
   health behavior change determinants, capable of influencing children's
   learning needs and behaviors, that were considered to design The Heroes
   of Diabetes-the power of knowledge.
   Results: The results presented the process of designing 4 mini games
   with its description and theory foundation to reach children's lack of
   understanding about T1D, insulin's role, SMBG requirements, food groups
   and physical activity's role in glycemic control. Knowledge, goal
   settings, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation determinants were related
   with video games design features.
   Conclusions: The findings support the use of health behavior change
   determinants into video game design as a guide to achieve children
   learning needs and that might influence self-management behaviors.},

Abstract = {Entering primary school is a very important moment for children. The
   need to conform with the rules of living together, contents structured
   to acquire skills, different teaching methods and different teachers
   causes fragile children stress, which may be associated in time with
   discomfort, feelings of inadequacy and inability due to disregarded
   performance. The school would thus fail in its main function to
   guarantee every pupil the right to education and competence. A solution
   can be sought in didactics that make use of technologies in multimodal
   environment to help pupils understand the contents of different
   messages. The synergy among teacher, content and tool becomes strategic,
   accessible and can be scheduled. The technology supports and levels
   cultural gaps and cognitive differences, making the classroom a
   child-friendly laboratory, where teachers plan cross-sectional and
   disciplinary courses by using multiple dimensions to express contents.
   The main objective is to investigate whether tutorials borrowed from
   video modeling and proposed in self-managed modalities, both to pupils
   and to the class group, at first facilitate the learning of cross
   contents in curricula, by improving the performance and perception of
   individual and peer group self efficacy in primary school (1st
   mid-term). Then if they facilitate the learning of disciplinary
   curricular contents (2nd mid-term).
   Specific activities to elaborate the goal:
   1) determining curricula and programs elements chosen by teachers to
   identify soft skills; 2) describing the learning tasks used in 1st grade
   (pupils aged 5 to 6 years in Italy) to develop these skills; 3)
   examining the designing features of videomodeling to identify the
   structure transferable to videos; 4) experiencing training courses with
   the use of tutorials, creating with tablets a customisable and
   self-managable learning environment for pupils, in an atmosphere of
   collaboration among peers and sharing of expertise that can be
   transferred to other learning contexts; 5) determining how the teacher's
   role changes. Information gathering instruments used:
   a) analysis of the curriculum and of the teacher's didactics routine
   b) analysis of students' perceptions, use of tutorials and productions.
   The differences in this section: literacy instrumental technology in
   use; separate moments of traditional and innovative education;
   laboratory activities under peer tutoring, in pairs and individually in
   order to acknowledge expertise
   c) checklists, participant observation, filming, diary writing.
   d) group interview of the participating students and teachers.
   Sample group: 66 first-grade pupils, heterogeneous in the socio-cultural
   background and nationality, not to mention the personal differences in
   the cognitive, social and relational field.
   Research duration: September 2015-June 2016. Main tool used: tablets.
   The data obtained will be analysed to assess whether the proposed
   methodology facilitates the formation of knowledge, the acquisition of
   soft skills, the know-how and its transfer.
   Conclusion
   The results presented refer to the first mid-term and test the steps of
   instrumental literacy, acquisition of knowledge and related know-how.
   The project pursues the possibility teachers have to build innovative
   educational practices, aimed at adopting those economic strategies
   functional to make children's education active that are given in school
   but can be used in contexts outside it.},

Abstract = {Since the inclusion of Spain in the Bologna Declaration, whose objective
   is to reform the university system through the European Higher Education
   Area (EHEA), the student acquires a leading role in the
   teaching-learning process. In order to promote autonomy among the
   students in the training process, the use of Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) is increasingly common. Among them,
   e-learning using mobile apps has a great potential to strengthen the
   learning process given its popular use among university students. This
   is mostly because these tools have assorted advantages over traditional
   methods, e.g. magisterial lectures, such as ubiquitous access,
   possibility to update and increase content, self-taught, etc. Moreover,
   they are easily linkable to social media, thus making the learning
   process more attractive, more easily accessible and more cooperative.
   For the purpose of increasing student motivation, in this work, a mobile
   application has been designed and developed, in which three
   laboratories, belonging to the faculties of Sciences (Biology and
   Chemistry) and Engineering, have been virtualized. In each of the three
   laboratories, the students can access to multimedia information
   corresponding to various materials and equipment, videos, links, virtual
   laboratories as well as an explanation of some practical sessions.
   For the different scenarios development, 360 degrees panoramic pictures
   have been used, which have been made using HDR (High Dynamic Range)
   techniques. The platform chosen for the development was Android, due to
   the majority use of this operating system on mobile devices among the
   students.
   It is good to notice that this type of e-learning facilitates students
   the accessibility to materials related to the practical subjects under
   study which are very important in science teaching. Also, they become
   more familiar with technical terms in an interactive, more entertaining
   and efficient manner, improving the motivation degree and the student's
   involvement in the subjects under study. This leads to a greater
   assimilation of knowledge and skills. To verify this, for each
   laboratory, we divided the students in a group without access to the app
   (control group) and another one (testing group) with access. We
   conducted a series of questionnaires with the testing groups using the
   game-based platform ``Kahoot!{''} and Google Forms. The questionnaires
   intended to enlighten the degree of acceptance of the tool, the impact
   on learning of the subjects under study and the identification of
   potential areas of improvement.
   Generally, the testing group students found the tool very interesting
   and helped them improving their scores compared to the control group. No
   clear distinction between students of different subjects was
   appreciated. A limited content in this first version was major drawback.
   Also, this evaluation has been conducted only with one control and one
   testing group of each subject, thus limiting its potential to extract
   definite conclusions. Further content upload and testing on different
   courses will be done in the future to evaluate the benefits of science
   learning using this app.},

Abstract = {This study focuses on learning in three different hypermedia
   environments that either support autonomous learning, learner-controlled
   learning or system-controlled learning and explores the mediating role
   of academic self-regulation style (ASRS; i.e. a macro level of
   motivation) on learning. This research was performed to gain more
   insight in the conditions under which learning in hypermedia
   environments is effective. Sixty-nine grade five students from a primary
   school answered short essay questions using video material from a
   hypermedia environment. The effects on task motivation and test
   performance were measured. It was found that learners in the autonomy
   supported hypermedia environment reported lower levels of controlled
   task motivation, compared to the learners in the system-controlled and
   learner-controlled hypermedia environments. But there were no effects of
   hypermedia environment on autonomous task motivation or the reported
   need fulfilment for autonomy. Furthermore, learners in the
   learner-controlled hypermedia environment scored lower on a delayed,
   In-Depth Knowledge Test compared to learners in the other two
   environments. Moreover, learners in the autonomy supported hypermedia
   environment watched more (unique) videos compared to learners in the
   system-controlled and the learner-controlled hypermedia environments. As
   for the role of learners' ASRS, we found no interaction with the type of
   hypermedia environment on task motivation or performance. Learners' ASRS
   did, however, affect the learners' motivation for the task. And, when
   presented with advice (as in the autonomy supported hypermedia
   environment) learners with an autonomous self-regulation style followed
   more advice, compared to learners with a more controlled self-regulation
   style.},

   learning needs of very young children. This study aimed to develop and
   assess the effectiveness of a video tape and picture book designed to
   teach children about the prevention and management of acute episodes of
   asthma. The information content of the educational resources was
   determined by analysis of relevant medical information and asthma
   management skills. Social Learning Theory and consideration of the
   developmental stage of the target population informed the format and
   style of presentation of the resources. Eighty children aged between 2
   and 5 years who had been diagnosed with asthma by their medical
   practitioner and who required daily asthma medication participated in a
   controlled experimental study. The study evaluated the impact of the
   asthma education resources on children's knowledge about asthma,
   compliance with medication regimens and health status. Children were
   randomly allocated to one of three experimental groups. Children in
   these groups were exposed to either the video tape alone, the book alone
   or both the video tape and book, or to a control group who viewed
   materials unrelated to asthma. The results for the three experimental
   groups were compared with the control group who did not receive exposure
   to any of the asthma education resources, The results showed that
   children in each experimental group had significantly greater gains in
   asthma-related knowledge than children in the control group and children
   exposed to both resources showed the greatest increases In knowledge.
   Children In each of the three experimental groups also had better
   compliance rand health than children in the control group, These
   findings indicate that carefully designed asthma education resources are
   useful for providing even the youngest children with information about
   asthma and its management.},

Title = {Signaling cues and focused prompts for professional vision support: The
   interplay of instructional design and situational interest in preservice
   teachers' video analysis},
Journal = {INSTRUCTIONAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 2},
Abstract = {In teacher education, video representations of practice offer a
   motivating means for applying conceptual teaching knowledge toward
   real-world settings. With video analysis, preservice teachers can begin
   cultivating professional vision skills through noticing and reasoning
   about presented core teaching practices. However, with novices' limited
   prior knowledge and experience, processing transient information from
   video can be challenging. Multimedia learning research suggests
   instructional design techniques for support, such as signaling keyword
   cues during video viewing, or presenting focused self-explanation
   prompts which target theoretical knowledge application during video
   analysis. This study investigates the professional vision skills of
   noticing and reasoning (operationalized as descriptions and
   interpretations of relevant noticed events) from 130 preservice teachers
   participating in a video-analysis training on the core practice of
   small-group instruction. By means of experimental comparisons, we
   examine the effects of signaling cues and focused self-explanation
   prompts on professional vision performance. Further, we explore the
   impact of these techniques, considering preservice teachers' situational
   interest. Overall, results demonstrated that preservice teachers'
   professional vision skills improved from pretest to posttest, but the
   instructional design techniques did not generally offer additional
   support. However, moderation analysis indicated that training with cues
   fostered professional vision skills for preservice teachers with low
   situational interest. This suggests that for uninterested novices,
   signaling cues may compensate for the generative processing boost
   typically associated with situational interest. Research and practice
   implications involve the consideration of situational interest as a
   powerful component of instructional design, and that keyword cueing can
   offer an alternative when interest is difficult to elicit.},

Abstract = {Social networks are spaces that reach a high percentage of people,
   especially young people, which make them an effective means to maintain
   a direct communication with them and to improve teaching and learning.
   The use of virtual learning environments facilitates the application of
   flipped learning that changes the traditional learning in the classroom,
   its approach proposes that students review theoretical concepts before
   attending class and spend more time practicing exercises.
   The objective was to impart the Elementary Programming Course applying
   the flipped learning mixed with social media, a virtual learning
   environment is used to access the self-study multimedia educational
   resources, which were shared by social networks.
   The teacher presents a summary of the subject by means of a mind map to
   validate that the student has the basic concepts, then proposes a game
   that was analyzed and the students designed the algorithm that later was
   codified in a programming language.
   In order to teach the Elementary Programming course, various multimedia
   educational resources such as e-books, video tutorials, knowledge
   capsules and learning objects were developed. Fun learning activities
   based on games were developed, which promoted the enthusiasm and
   interest of the students.
   It was observed that the pedagogical strategy of the flipped learning
   promotes student self-study by encouraging their motivation and raising
   their self-esteem. The course benefited students of Public Policy, Art
   and Digital Design and Engineering of the Metropolitan Autonomus
   University Lerma, obtaining encouraging results. Educational benefits,
   as well as limitations and areas of opportunity were identified,
   providing a framework to improve similar studies in the future.},

Abstract = {The purpose of this system is to establish virtual medical school (VMS)
   as the platform of e-learning center, which integrates collaborative and
   self-directed learning environment by virtual group, classroom and
   library, and automatically converts valuable clinical case from Hospital
   Information System (HIS) database into virtual patient by online
   authoring tools for problem-based e-learning. In this system, the VMS
   provides a problem-based e-learning environment, and utilizes HIS to
   capture and store valuable clinical cases. All medical students and
   residents now have the opportunity to learn from these typical cases on
   line. The VMS at National Taiwan University has the potential to develop
   into a national medical education network for the mediation and
   provision of comprehensive medical resources. The system will use the
   international standard SCORM 1.2 to develop teaching material and assist
   with the HL7 v2.4, CDA v1.0 standards to connect Electronic Medical
   Record (EMR) systems in the hospital. It can provide resources sharing
   among medical centers by using high transportation ability of Grid
   Computing integrated with the broadband video platform, Access Grid, and
   personal multiple point videoconference platform, Multi-video, to
   popularize the application of e-learning in clinical medical education.},

Abstract = {Purpose The main goal of this investigation is to analyze the
   implementation of a forced blended-learning program in social sciences
   higher education in a post-pandemic COVID-19 context. To reach that
   target, the authors suggest two specific objectives (S.O.): S.O.1 To
   analyze the motivation, the resources and the learning effectiveness of
   the program. S.O.2 To establish the differences emerged between the
   participants. Design/methodology/approach The blended-learning program
   selected was based on the flipped-classroom model (Krasulia, 2017). The
   implementation consisted of a 20-min flipped classroom to flexibly
   follow the theoretical contents through self-elaborated videos uploaded
   on YouTube and adapted to all kinds of devices, two online theoretical
   hours driven by the teacher on the Zoom application per week with the
   whole group to augment explanations and solve doubts and two hours of
   face-to-face interaction to work cooperatively in small groups of 4-5
   students per week. During these practical lessons, the students
   completed exercises, research reports, oral presentations and a
   gamification quiz developed each week through the Socrative application
   to keep the students engaged. Findings All the participants agree in
   very positively valuating the small-group seminars and the teacher's
   role in the process. This is surely caused because of the pandemic
   fatigue and the restrictions (Mali and Lim, 2021) that were running
   during the fall semester of year 2020/2021 when in Spain lived the
   in-between of the second and third wave of SARS-CoV2. So, as educators
   and investigators, the authors encourage teachers to incorporate
   face-to-face interaction elements in forced blended-learning programs,
   to include seminars in small groups to work cooperatively and to provide
   the students support and a quick resolution of doubts. Originality/value
   This study provides a significant value in support of a number of
   studies cited in the study. The study highlights the need for a
   standardised application of active methods in a standardised way.},

Abstract = {One of the recognized ways to enhance teaching and learning is having
   insights into the behavior patterns of students. Studies that explore
   behavior patterns in online self-directed learning (OSDL) are scant
   though. In addition, the focus is lacking on how high-achieving (HA)
   students' behavior patterns affect the academic performance of
   low-achieving (LA) students. To fill these research gaps, this study
   investigates (1) how the behavior patterns in OSDL vary between HA and
   LA students and (2) how HA students' behavior patterns affect LA
   students' academic performance. We used three perspectives of learning
   achievement, engagement, and cognitive load to examine academic
   performance. By utilizing process mining, we reviewed the log data of 71
   college students on the Moodle platform and designed a pretest-posttest
   test without a control group. Results show obvious variances in the
   behavior patterns between HA and LA students. In particular, HA students
   performed more OSDL behaviors; their behavior patterns were more in line
   with self-directed logic. By contrast, LA students exhibited
   unmethodical behavior patterns; they were unable to process course
   content in depth. An instructional intervention was created with HA
   students' behavior patterns as basis. The engagement of LA students
   increased, and their cognitive load was reduced after the instructional
   intervention. However, their learning achievement did not increase
   substantially. The interview results were consistent with the
   quantitative data. These findings indicate that the behavior patterns of
   HA students can shed light on how to guide the OSDL of LA students. This
   study also provides fresh methodological perspectives for assessing
   OSDL.},

Title = {New opportunities for the use of digital video in on-line radiologic
   curricula},
Journal = {ACADEMIC RADIOLOGY},

Abstract = {Rationale and Objectives. To explore techniques to conveniently and
   self-sufficiently create high-quality, web-ready instructional digital
   video snippets suitable for routine use in on-line radiologic curricula.
   Materials. A commercially available digital camera with an 8-megapixel
   image receptor and the capability to record web-ready digital video and
   audio at a resolution of up to 640 x 480 pixels and a frame rate of up
   to 30 per second was used to obtain video snippets intended for
   inclusion in on-line curricula. Hand-held and tripod techniques were
   compared. Evaluation focused on the types of snippets deemed most likely
   to be used within on-line educational content, ranging in length from 10
   seconds to 2 minutes. Additionally, basic postprocessing functions to
   experiment with combinations of video-file size, format, transmission
   efficiency, and image quality were used.
   Results. The overall video quality was considered by participating
   radiologists to be good to excellent for its intended purposes. For most
   situations tested, a matrix size of 320 x 240 pixels provided a good
   balance of visual quality versus file size and transmission overhead.
   The 640 x 480 format was occasionally optimal, but was usually larger
   than necessary and resulted in substantially larger files, especially at
   a rate of 30 frames per second. A rate of 15 frames per second was
   considered adequate for most situations, regardless of matrix size,
   although it did add some barely discernible choppiness to the display.
   For all but very short snippets, a tripod or some other form of
   stabilization was necessary to eliminate distracting ``camera shake{''}
   associated with free-hand acquisition. With a tripod, appropriate
   ambient lighting, and a favorable acoustical environment, videos of
   excellent quality when using the highest settings available on the
   camera (640 x 480, 30 frames/sec) could be self-sufficiently produced.
   However, such high-quality video with its associated large file size was
   rarely the optimal fit for the needs of this curricula.
   Conclusion. These results indicate that newer-generation digital cameras
   are useful for quickly and inexpensively producing high-quality,
   web-ready digital video suitable for use in on-line education. (C) AUR,

Title = {First-year medical students' perceptions of a self-regulated
   learning-informed intervention: an exploratory study},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {NOV 29},
Abstract = {Background Students with developed self-regulated learning (SRL) skills
   demonstrate an ability to set individualized educational goals, select
   optimal learning strategies for reaching these goals, and reflect on
   overall progress. The primary aims of this study were to investigate
   first-year medical students' perceived utility of a self-regulated
   learning-informed intervention and to assess the impact of its
   implementation on students' intended use of SRL throughout medical
   school. Methods A two-part educational intervention focused on SRL skill
   development was carried out at Harvard Medical School during the start
   of the 2021 academic year. For the first component of the intervention,
   169 first-year medical students engaged in an interactive class session
   structured around SRL concept videos, a brief lecture, small group
   discussions and individual reflection. Students completed pre- and
   post-intervention surveys which inquired about learners' current and
   anticipated application of SRL skills. During the second component of
   the intervention, 15 first-year medical students participated in a set
   of one-on-one academic SRL coaching sessions. All coaching participants
   completed follow-up semi-structured interviews. Results A statistically
   significant increase was observed between students' use of skills in all
   domains of self-regulated learning prior to the intervention and their
   anticipated use of these skills following the intervention. Prior to the
   intervention, 60.1\% (n = 92) of students reported utilizing
   evidence-based learning strategies, compared to 92.8\% (n = 142) of
   students (p < 0.001) who anticipated applying this SRL skills at the
   completion of the classroom session. Six core themes emerged from
   qualitative analysis of the post-intervention survey including learning
   plan development, accountability and progress tracking, goals for
   growth, engagement through active learning, routine reflection, and
   adapting to the curriculum. Conclusions Both classroom-based learning
   sessions and one-on-one academic coaching programs are feasible
   approaches for encouraging the use of self-regulated learning techniques
   in the preclinical setting.},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This study explored the relationships between identity, science
   learning, and gaming. A survey of 1502 teenagers assessed gaming
   preferences, habits, science learning, science and gamer identities.
   Hierarchical regression analyses revealed that enjoyment of
   problem-solving games and identifying as a gamer were the strongest
   predictors for teens' science understanding. Teen preferences for games
   with science-related features, and competence in problem-solving games
   were significant predictors of teens' understanding of science. Teens
   who preferred collaborative social games over science-oriented games
   were less likely to understand the nature of science. Teens with a
   stronger science identity were more likely to negatively evaluate their
   gaming groups, preferred problem-solving games, and claimed greater
   competence in games with science-related features when compared to those
   who do not self-identify as science thinkers. Results suggest that games
   that seek to support those who do not feel successful in science
   learning should focus on social interaction and involve activities and
   experiences that could be utilized in the real world rather than problem
   solving games. Results suggest that science-focused games may reinforce
   perceived self-efficacy and sense of competence in real world scientific
   reasoning situations for those already predisposed to feel confident as
   science thinkers. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {The rapid advancement of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technology
   has increasingly drawn attention to its potential applications in the
   educational sector. This study aims to investigate the effects of
   Situational Interactive Teaching, facilitated by generative artificial
   intelligence, on students' learning outcomes and flow experiences. A
   series of experiments were designed to compare the performance of a
   Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported Situational Interactive
   Teaching Method with a Traditional Video Interactive Teaching Method.
   Data was collected using research tools such as questionnaires and test
   questions to assess students' cognitive levels, learning effectiveness,
   flow experiences, and subjective evaluations during the instructional
   process. The analysis revealed distinct differences between the two
   teaching methods. The findings suggest that compared to traditional
   teaching methods, Generative Artificial Intelligence-supported
   Situational Interactive Teaching significantly improves students'
   learning outcomes in cognitive, skill, and affective domains, while also
   enhancing flow experiences. These positive effects are not limited by
   individual student differences, indicating broad applicability.
   Furthermore, this teaching approach can foster a positive feedback loop
   between learning effectiveness and flow experience. In conclusion, this
   study confirms the effective application of generative artificial
   intelligence technology in legal education, providing empirical evidence
   for the promotion of this innovative teaching model in the educational
   field.},

Abstract = {E-learning is regularly promoted in higher education settings as a way
   of fostering more flexible approaches to learning. It has been argued
   however that the `potential benefits of new information and
   communication technology instruments in education' have not been
   subjected to critical scrutiny (Debande, O., 2004. ICTs and the
   development of e-learning in Europe: the role of the public and private
   sectors. European Journal of Education 39 (2), 191-208, p. 192). This
   paper outlines a multi-method evaluation of an e-learning innovation
   designed to teach clinical skills to Student nurses. Responding to the
   challenges of teaching clinical skills to large class sizes, we
   developed a set of instructional videos for one undergraduate
   skills-based module, which are now integral to the module and available
   online to students on a continuous basis. Evaluation suggests that
   students' performance outcomes are unchanged. The students view the
   flexible and self-management aspects of this method of learning
   positively, with some attitudinal differences between male and female,
   and mature and non-mature students. However, it is best used to
   complement rather than replace lecturer demonstration, tending support
   to a `blended' model (Collis, B., van der Wende, M., 2002. Models of

Abstract = {IntroductionE-learning has gained momentum in health sciences and seems
   to have great potential in specialist dental education. Higher
   acceptability by learners is particularly associated with the surge of
   smart devices. Currently, there are limited number of e-learning modules
   available for dental education, particularly in Orthodontics.
   Material and methodsScenario Based Learning interactive (SBLi (R))
   software was used for the first time in Orthodontics Postgraduate
   training at the University of Queensland. Nine interactive modules were
   created embedded with clinical procedure videos, web-links,
   evidence-based literature, along with opportunity for self-assessment
   and evaluation. Qualitative data were collected before and after the
   administration of the SBLi (R) for Orthodontics. The purpose of this
   data was to investigate learning styles and the acceptance of e-modules
   as part of postgraduate training.
   ResultsAdvantages of the package included high acceptance rate, greater
   confidence in the application of clinical skills covered in the modules
   and reduced contact time particularly with limited academic staff.
   E-modules demonstrated high compatibility with the learning styles of
   the participants and were considered engaging.
   ConclusionsIt seems apparent that e-learning is most effective in a
   blended learning environment, supplemented with the traditional
   classroom approach, rather than as a sole mechanism for postgraduate
   training.},

Abstract = {This study investigated the effects of an instructional package

   training, and behavioral rehearsal on the cooperative classroom behavior
   of two second-grade children with learning and behavior problems.
   Observations were made of selected classroom behaviors in three
   different classes each day. Results indicate that the intervention was
   effective in helping young children acquire cooperative classroom
   behaviors, generalize these behaviors to settings not a part of the
   training environment, and maintain these behaviors in both the training
   and generalization settings. The video intervention package also was
   effective in reducing inappropriate behaviors in the training and
   generalization settings. Further, there was a marked reduction in
   variability of behavior for both children. The results suggest that
   video-based modeling, coupled with discrimination training and
   rehearsal, is an effective and efficient intervention for early
   elementary school children with learning and behavior problems.},

Abstract = {While the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the crucial importance of
   Self-Regulated Learning (SRL), many studies have indicated a lack of
   programs that provide training for both K-12 students and their
   teachers, who play a central role in training and guiding their
   students. The research described herein aims to bridge this gap by
   proposing and implementing a hybrid intervention program comprising both
   teacher and student training, using videos accompanied by prompts
   (questions) and other learning components aiming to promote SRL in
   problem-solving. The study involved 296 K-12 students from the Arab
   community in Israel, whose teachers participated in the teacher training
   program. The research goals were: (1) to examine the effect of the
   intervention on the achievements of the experimental group (with
   intervention) versus the control group (without intervention), and the
   pre-intervention achievements; (2) to examine the effect of the
   intervention on students' use of time management strategies; and the
   cognitive strategy of elaboration; (3) to examine the predictors of
   students' achievements, including students' motivation and their use of
   time management, cognitive, metacognitive, and reflective strategies.
   The findings revealed significant differences in post-intervention
   achievements between the experimental and control groups, and compared
   to pre-intervention achievements. Moreover, positive significant
   correlations were found between the number of videos viewed and prompts
   answered with students' achievements. Additionally, significant
   differenceswere found in students' use of time management strategies
   between pre-and post-intervention in the experimental group.
   Furthermore, an increase in using the cognitive strategy elaboration in
   the experimental group was observed. Lastly, students' employment of
   time management strategies was found to predict their achievements, and
   the regression equation was significant.},

Title = {Exploring HTML5 Package Interactive Content in Supporting Learning
   Through Self-Paced Massive Open Online Courses on Healthy Aging:Mixed
   Methods Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background: The rapidly aging population and the growth of geriatric
   medicine in the field of internal medicine are not supportedby
   sufficient gerontological training in many health care disciplines.
   There is rising awareness about the education and trainingneeded to
   adequately prepare health care professionals to address the needs of the
   older adult population. Massive open onlinecourses (MOOCs) might be the
   best alternative method of learning delivery in this context. However,
   the diversity of MOOCparticipants poses a challenge for MOOC providers
   to innovate in developing learning content that suits the needs and
   charactersof participants.Objective: The primary outcome of this study
   was to explore students'perceptions and acceptance of HTML5 package
   (H5P)interactive content in self-paced MOOCs and its association with
   students'characteristics and experience in using MOOCs.Methods: This
   study used a cross-sectional design, combining qualitative and
   quantitative approaches. Participants, predominantlygeneral
   practitioners from various regions of Indonesia with diverse educational
   backgrounds and age groups, completed pretests,engaged with H5P
   interactive content, and participated in forum discussions and
   posttests. Data were retrieved from the onlinequestionnaire attached to
   a selected MOOC course. Students'perceptions and acceptance of H5P
   interactive content were ratedon a 6-point Likert scale from 1 (strongly
   disagree) to 6 (strongly agree). Data were analyzed using SPSS (IBM
   Corp) to examinedemographics, computer literacy, acceptance, and
   perceptions of H5P interactive content. Quantitative analysis explored
   correlations,while qualitative analysis identified recurring themes from
   open-ended survey responses to determine students'perceptions.Results:
   In total, 184 MOOC participants agreed to participate in the study.
   Students demonstrated positive perceptions and ahigh level of acceptance
   of integrating H5P interactive content within the self-paced MOOC.
   Analysis of mean (SD) value acrossall responses consistently revealed
   favorable scores (greater than 5), ranging from 5.18 (SD 0.861) to 5.45
   (SD 0.659) and 5.28(SD 0.728) to 5.52 (SD 0.627), respectively. This
   finding underscores widespread satisfaction and robust acceptance of
   H5Pinteractive content. Students found the H5P interactive content more
   satisfying and fun, easier to understand, more effective, andmore
   helpful in improving learning outcomes than material in the form of
   common documents and learning videos. There is asignificant correlation
   between computer literacy, students'acceptance, and
   students'perceptions.Conclusions: Students from various backgrounds
   showed a high level of acceptance and positive perceptions of
   leveragingH5P interactive content in the self-paced MOOC. The findings
   suggest potential new uses of H5P interactive content in MOOCs, such as
   interactive videos with pop-up questions, to substitute for synchronous
   learning. The study underscores the significanceof tailored educational
   strategies in supporting the professional development of health care
   professionals},

Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {164},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {This study evaluates the validity of an algorithm for measuring the
   efficiency of social learning networks in discussion forums accompanying
   MOOCs of conventional format, which consist of video lectures and
   problem assignments. The algorithm models social learning networks as a
   function of users knowledge seeking and knowledge disseminating
   tendencies across course topics and offers a means to optimize social
   learning networks by connecting users seeking and disseminating
   information on specific topics. We use the algorithm to analyze the
   social learning network manifest in the discussion format of a MOOC
   forum incorporating video lectures and problem assignments. As a measure
   of the degree that knowledge seekers and knowledge disseminators are
   connected in the network, we observe a very sparse network with few
   discussion participants and a limited range of topics. Hence, only small
   gains are available through optimization, since for a very sparse
   network, few connections can be made. The development of a metric for
   the analysis of social learning networks would provide instructors and
   researchers with a means to optimize online learning environments for
   empowering social learning. Finally, we discuss our findings with
   respect to the potential of self-optimizing discussion forums for
   supporting social learning online.},

   administration for undergraduate student nurses: A mixed methods,
   prospective cohort study},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2013},
Volume = {33},
Number = {6},
Pages = {663-670},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Background: Improvements in the safety of the prescribing, dispensing
   and administration of medicines are identified as a priority across
   international healthcare systems. It is therefore essential that higher
   education institutions play their part in helping to meet this patient
   safety objective. New developments in clinical skills education which
   are aligned to emerging educational theory are available, but
   evaluations and supportive evidence are limited.
   Objectives: To evaluate the use of an online best practice exemplar as
   an adjunct to the clinical skills teaching of oral medication
   administration to undergraduate student nurses.
   Design: Mixed-methods prospective cohort design.
   Settings and Participants: Two intakes of undergraduate nursing students
   (n = 168, n = 154) undertaking a first year clinical skills based module
   at a British university.
   Methods: The Control group received standard teaching using lectures and
   skills classes facilitated by experienced clinical skills lecturers. The
   Intervention group received the standard teaching and unlimited access
   to an online video clip of medication administration. Performance and
   satisfaction were measured using module assessment results and a
   satisfaction questionnaire. Qualitative data were gathered using focus
   groups (n = 16, n = 20).
   Results: The Intervention group was significantly (p = 0.021) more
   likely to pass the assessment and rate their satisfaction with the
   teaching significantly higher (p<0.05) on more than half of the items
   from the Student Satisfaction Survey. Two Categories were identified
   from focus group data; Classroom Learning and Transfer to Practice.
   Classroom Learning included four themes of Peers, Self, Teaching and
   Time and when Classroom Learning was positive, the Transfer to Practice
   of the clinical skill was enhanced.
   Conclusions: An online video of a best practice exemplar as an adjunct
   to taught clinical skills sessions improves student assessment results
   and satisfaction ratings. The video was also reported to positively
   influence all themes identified in Classroom Learning and was perceived
   to promote the Transfer to Practice of teaching input. (c) 2012 Elsevier

Abstract = {This paper analyses the potential for school principals' professional
   development of the work in small groups as a strategy implemented by a
   highly-structured training program based on reflection and group
   coaching and addressed to principals with different degrees of
   experience. A total of 94 experienced principals were involved in the
   program, grouped into 14 groups of six participants plus a coach. They
   came from schools of different characteristics along the eight
   Andalusian provinces. For the purpose of the paper, a first assessment
   of the second version of the program has been carried out, based on a
   satisfaction questionnaire fulfilled by the participants and the
   observation of the sessions, which were video-recorded and analysed by
   means of an ad hoc category system. The study proved the capacity of a
   specific self-learning training tool in order to promote a real
   change/learning of the participants' conceptions about school
   leadership. Some groups achieved a deep reflection about their members'
   practices. The analysis of the interaction process inside the group
   allowed the researchers to identify the critical issues that impeded the
   other groups to achieve such learning. Program design produced overall
   satisfaction in the totality of the participants, independently of the

Abstract = {Researching self-regulated teaming (SRL) as a process that evolves
   across multiple episodes of studying poses large methodological
   challenges. While self-report data provide useful information about
   learners' perceptions of teaming, these data are not reliable indicators
   of studying tactics learners actually use while studying, especially
   when learners are young children. We argue that self-reports about SRL
   need to be augmented by fine-grained traces that are records of
   learners' actual activities as they study. We describe how gStudy
   software unobtrusively collects detailed trace data about learners' use
   of study tactics as they engage with content presented in teaming
   kits-collections of docurnents (e.g., texts, graphics, video clips) and
   tasks (e.g., notes, concept maps) on which learners operate to study. We
   suggest that trace data can advance research about how learners select,
   monitor, assemble, rehearse, and translate information to learn it, and
   provide raw materials for mapping SRL and its effects. Examples from the
   Lift Cycles Learning Kit that supports grade I students teaming about
   the life cycles of humans and frogs are given.},

Abstract = {HTTP Streaming is nowadays the main approach for delivering
   video-streaming on the Internet. As a consequence of that, the widely
   deployed HTTP infrastructures face new challenges posed by the
   sensitivity of video-streaming users to service quality degradation and
   the specificities of video-streaming workloads. Performance issues
   represent one main class of problems in the server infrastructure that
   can result into a significant deterioration of the end-users' quality of
   experience (QoE), proportional to the upfront time spent by them
   watching the videos. This paper addresses the development of autonomic
   HTTP Streaming servers organized into Autonomic Elements (AEs), the
   building blocks of Autonomic Computing (AC) systems. AEs are structured
   using container-based virtualization and are provided with monitoring,
   failure prediction, failure diagnosis and repair features. These
   features are incorporated into SHStream, a self-healing framework
   developed by us. SHStream relies on online learning algorithms to build
   and evaluate classification models dynamically for prediction and
   diagnosis of performance anomalies. The results of our experimental
   analysis have shown that: (1) failure prediction can be performed with
   approximately of precision; (2) the diagnosis activity can localize and
   identify the resource responsible for performance failures, without
   misclassifications; (3) the classifiers' performance stabilizes using a
   small number of learning instances; and (4) container-based
   virtualization technologies enable recovery times shorter than 1 s
   through rebooting and shorter than 3 s using server migration
   techniques.},

Abstract = {Blended learning using flipped classroom has emerged as a remarkable
   model for bridging the digital divide between geographically- and
   socio-economically disadvantaged students during the Covid pandemic,
   especially for those situated in remote locations with limited interact
   connectivity. This paper presents an investigation of a blended learning
   framework using flipped teaching through interactive video lectures for
   an Introduction to Electrical Engineering course held in online mode for
   a first-year batch of engineering students. The analysis includes
   observations from two sets of students who took this course over the
   last two academic years, referred to as control and treatment groups,
   respectively. The paper also reports a simple preliminary framework for
   utilizing the analytics available from interactive video assignments for
   identifying students with poor engagement and understanding so that the
   instructor may adopt timely measures and interventions to address the
   need of all students. The success of the video assignments are validated
   both qualitatively (through student feedback and performance) and
   quantitatively (using t-test). Results show that the flipped teaching
   model has both empirical approval and support of a majority of students,
   especially in the distance learning mode. Statistical analysis shows a
   significant difference in the performance of students with and without
   video-based flipped teaching in online mode.},

Abstract = {Language assistance becomes an integral component of the
   teaching-learning process in -non-English-speaking multilingual
   societies where education takes place predominantly in local languages.
   Subtitles have been found to be beneficial in facilitating understanding
   of the English language medium media in such situations. However, when
   accompanied with subtitles, information-rich instructional materials can
   add to the learner's cognitive load as their attention must be split
   between the content and the subtitle. To evaluate the cognitive and
   affective impacts of subtitle language on learning, we conducted a
   multimodal study using eye tracking, electroencephalogram (EEG),
   self-report, and pre-post test data from 51 individuals watching a
   12-minute educational video in those who had no subtitles, those who had
   English subtitles (L2) and those who had subtitles in their native
   language (L1). We discovered (a) positive learning gains for groups with
   subtitles, whether L1 or L2, which suggested positive impact of
   subtitles on learning outcome; (b) native language subtitling yielded
   the highest instructional efficiency and supported effective
   distribution of visual attention between slide content and subtitle; (c)
   native language subtitles elicited the lowest cognitive load, as
   evidenced by both EEG measurements and self-report data; and (d) gaze
   data highlighted key strategies of high and low performers during
   interaction with subtitled media.},

Abstract = {In typical computer vision problems revolving around video data,
   pre-trained models are simply evaluated at test time, without
   adaptation. This general approach clearly cannot capture the shifts that
   will likely arise between the distributions from which training and test
   data have been sampled. Adapting a pre-trained model to a new video
   encountered at test time could be essential to avoid the potentially
   catastrophic effects of such shifts. However, given the inherent
   impossibility of labeling data only available at testtime, traditional
   `fine-tuning{''} techniques cannot be leveraged in this highly practical
   scenario. This paper explores whether the recent progress in test-time
   adaptation in the image domain and self-supervised learning can be
   leveraged to adapt a model to previously unseen and unlabelled videos
   presenting both mild (but arbitrary) and severe covariate shifts. In our
   experiments, we show that test-time adaptation approaches applied to
   self-supervised methods are always beneficial, but also that the extent
   of their effectiveness largely depends on the specific combination of
   the algorithms used for adaptation and self-supervision, and also on the
   type of covariate shift taking place.},

Abstract = {The need for successful self-directed distance learning is not a new
   construct in education. However, the circumstances surrounding the
   emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic have emphasized the weaknesses of
   distance learning. The transition of students to distance learning has
   become inevitable. In current times, educators' task is to ensure the
   same quality of distance learning as in-person learning. The present
   paper contributes to our understanding of this task by examining good
   practice recommendations in instructional design. The experiment's focus
   is the effectiveness of interactive 3D learning tools in engineering
   studies depending on the level of study, i.e., prior knowledge of the
   students. Two separate experiments were conducted with 138 first-year
   and final-year university students studying the same material in three
   different instructional designs: interactive animation, continuous video
   and images. All three groups received textual information through
   identical narration. The results showed statistical significance among
   the lower prior knowledge students regarding knowledge transfer issues,
   while there was no statistically significant difference among the
   respondents with higher prior knowledge. These results suggest that
   substantial financial resources and time can be saved in preparing
   materials for various degrees in higher education.},

   video-based coaching sessions at 2 tertiary care centers. Eight
   residents and 3 attendings participated. Ten-point Likert-type
   questionnaires on the extent to which attendings taught 12 topics
   through 8 techniques were completed by residents after surgical and
   coaching sessions. Coaching sessions and structured interviews with
   residents were audio-recorded, transcribed and iteratively coded.
   Results: Seven audio-recordings were available for coaching sessions,
   during which a mean of 2.22 +/- 0.5 topics per minute were discussed. Of
   the 12 teaching topics, technique was discussed most frequently (32\%,
   0.71 +/- 0.2 topics/min), followed by anatomy (16\%, 0.31 +/- 0.16
   topics/min). Of all 8 ratings between coaching and operative sessions,
   residents indicated a greater extent of discussion of anatomy (median
   difference, {[}95\% confidence interval (CI)] of 3 {[}1-4]), progress
   (2.25 {[}95\% CI, 0.5-4]), technique (3.5 {[}95\% CI, 1.5-5.5]),
   pitfalls (2.5 {[}95\% CI, 1-3.5]), and summarizing (3 {[}95\% CI, 1-5]).
   In structured interviews, residents reported improved self-confidence
   and global perspective. Conclusions: Video-based coaching is
   educationally dense and characterized by perceived richer teaching and
   promotion of a deeper surgical understanding. It requires no additional
   resources, can be completed in a short period of time and can be
   implemented programmatically for any otolaryngologic subspecialty
   utilizing video-recording capable equipment.},

Title = {Content Analysis of YouTube Videos That Demonstrate Panoramic
   Radiography},
Journal = {HEALTHCARE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {In this digital era, dental students often search for online resources
   for self-directed learning. YouTube is one of the most commonly sought
   online platforms for educational or instructional videos. No prior study
   has examined the validity of panoramic radiography videos available on
   YouTube. This study provides a content analysis of these YouTube videos.
   A search for relevant YouTube videos was conducted in April 2022. The
   search string was: (panoramic OR pan OR OPG) AND (dental OR dentistry OR
   X-ray). The first 100 videos that resulted from the search and their
   related videos were screened. Exclusion criteria included irrelevance
   (e.g., no demonstration of panoramic radiography procedures) and
   non-English videos. For each included video, the following parameters
   were recorded: image receptor type, patient age, patient type (real
   patient, animation, or phantom head), patient preparation procedures,
   machine preparation, patient positioning, and operator safety. The
   number of views, comments, likes, and channel subscribers were recorded,
   as well as the video duration and the age of the video. Forty videos
   were included and analyzed. Most of the videos demonstrated digital
   panoramic radiography with an adult patient. Procedures on the patient
   and machine preparations as well as patient positioning were generally
   explained well. However, most videos did not well-demonstrate operator
   safety details concerning the use of adequate personal protective
   equipment. View count, comment count, and channel subscriber count
   positively correlated with the like count. Clinicians and students
   should carefully critique the content of such instructional videos and
   refer to the contents from other sources such as user manuals and latest
   recommendations from local authorities.},

Abstract = {Anatomy and physiology interactive video clips were introduced into a
   blended learning environment, as an optional resource, and were accessed
   by similar to 50\% of the cohort. Student feedback indicated that clips
   were engaging, assisted understanding of course content, and provided
   lecture support. Students could also access two other optional online
   resources, lecture capture recordings and an interactive atlas of
   anatomy, and individuals were tracked with respect to their access
   behavior, learning approach, and subject score. Deep learning was
   highest among those accessing the clips or atlas or those accessing more
   online resources, and thus self-regulatory skill development might be a
   useful approach to increase student access to optional online resources.
   Those who accessed clips, lecture capture recordings, or atlas achieved
   a significantly higher subject score than those who did not. When
   combinations of resources used were considered, we found an
   approximately linear relationship between number of resources accessed
   and subject score, with a 16\% difference in score between those who
   accessed none or all of the resources. However, the low resource access
   rate suggests that academic advantage may not be simply due to the
   learning support offered by the resources. As students accessing the
   optional resources tended to be more self-regulated, it may be that it
   was the extra effort made with respect to other subject resources,
   rather than just the access to the online resources, that contributed to
   higher subject score. Further studies are required to establish the
   relationships between academic performance, optional online resource
   access, and deep learning.},

Abstract = {The research project was developed inside a multidisciplinary cultural
   environment: the students, graduated in technology courses or a
   psyhco-cognitive training, learn the basic knowledge of visual
   communication and design.
   Starting from a constructivist pedagogical perspective, the Visual
   Design class - held inside the Theory and Technology of Communication
   Degree Programme at Milano-Bicocca University -was designed to build up
   a global, immediate, direct student experience giving up with the
   traditional approach that separates a previous stage to learn guidelines
   and rules and a successive direct application.
   According with the constructivist theoretical approach the whole course
   of Visual Design was designed and improved during the years, exploiting
   the potentiality of collaborative dynamics of web 2.0 \& social
   networks.
   The final goal was the immediate involvement of the students as leading
   subject in the manifold activities of the visual communication design.
   Classe's activities were focused on retrieving, discriminating,
   elaborating, discussing, sharing, producing and disseminating cultural
   content on basic visual design main issues.
   Students - divided in team working on monographic issues like: the
   grammar of visual design, digital typography, the language of colors,
   use and meaning of images and so on - were supported in a
   self-development and self-teaching process through a collaborative
   approach.
   In this experiment, the role of didactics was to coach and to enable the
   learning process based on the experience, to gain the ability to
   discriminate between Internet sources and materials, or to propose
   theoretical or disciplinary point of views.
   The class was supported by a FaceBook Page to post links, videos, images
   and other stuff, where invited practitioners and experts shared in an
   open dialog the knowledge and professional experience. Seminars and
   interviews were other supports to discover, from leading contributors of
   the field the recent history of graphic design.
   The final assignment was to edit and publishing on a print-on-demand
   platform and ePublishing free distributors a professional - although
   User Generated - essay to directly implement in a real project the
   learned and shared principles and notions.
   The project will be prosecuted next year: the new class will use the
   edited eBoooks to learn the visual design principles and will be
   requested to improve and to enhance examples, bibliography and materials
   elaborated during the previous year.},

Abstract = {In the COVID-19 pandemic period, most students felt lonely, accordingly
   their motivation for self-learning was low. The study aimed to increase
   their enthusiasm for work, and to improve their learning of biochemical
   subjects in the medical education programme during the pandemic period.
   Small parts of educational materials (microlearning) were presented in
   different formats such as videos, interactive education exercises,
   game-based quizzes and final exam was taken. The achievement of learning
   objectives of the course was evaluated by a survey. Students
   participating in daily activities gained higher self-confidence in
   learning and their final exam grade was higher compared to
   non-participating students (7.35 +/- 1.37 vs 7.06 +/- 1.88, p = 0.038).
   Most of the students agreed that daily activities (52\%) increased their
   motivation to work. This approach might be proposed as a practice that
   supports distance learning, or even traditional education, especially in
   medical education that includes complex issues.},

Journal = {EDUCATION IN THE KNOWLEDGE SOCIETY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {23},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {The aim of the project was to analyse the relationship between academic
   performance and video game consumption in primary schoolchildren. For
   this purpose, a descriptive cross-sectional study was designed with a
   sample of 125 Spanish schoolchildren. Academic performance was
   calculated through the grade obtained by the schoolchildren in the first
   and second evaluations carried out in the subjects described in Decree
   89/2014, August 1th, wich establishes the organi-zation and curriculum
   of Primary Education in the Autonomous Community of the Canary Islands.
   The questionnaire on video game consumption habits was used to calculate
   the consumption of video games. The statistical analysis carried out
   reflects a significant association between video game consumption and
   academic performance (p < .05); specifically with a higher average
   failure rate compared to their counterpart peers who pass (p < .05). In
   addition, the linear regression test reflected that higher video game
   consumption is associated with a higher probability of lower overall
   academic performance (beta =-4.504; t =-.263; p < .05). In conclusion,
   higher video game consumption is associated with lower academic
   performance. Consequently, the educational con-text and the family
   context must guide schoolchildren in learning self-regulation in the
   consump-tion of video games to avoid inappropriate use.},

Abstract = {The new paradigm for knowledgement acquisition in the European Higher
   Education Area (EHEA) is focused on the basis that students play and
   active role in their own learning process. The new educational models of
   academic formation are based on the concepts of integral formation,
   connexion with enterprises and, most important, improvement of personal
   talents through development of instrumental, interpersonal and
   systematic competences. For a proper teaching-learning environment it is
   in consequence mandatory to follow an integral educational program that
   considers the presential and non-presential activities as a whole, in
   the understanding of the utmost importance of the out of class students'
   time.
   From this point of view, it seems more than appropriate the use of a
   learning system that combines Internet and digital media with
   established classroom forms that require the physical co-presence of
   teacher and students, i.e. the blended learning.
   In this contribution the authors make a proposal of implementation of
   virtual technological tools in nonpresential activities with the aim of
   building a blended learning pedagogical framework for the subject
   ``Chemistry{''}, which is being taught in the first year of the
   mathematics degree at the University of Alicante (Spain). Two virtual
   tools were selected for the mentioned purpose: video-tutorials and
   virtual laboratories. Both were implanted in a complete teaching
   methodology that, properly integrated with presential lectures, pursues
   the two main objectives that follow: i) be a solid reinforcement of the
   concepts developed in class and ii) have enough scientific entity to
   launch new ideas on the less developed items in the presential lectures.
   In the specific proposal of this work, the authors present and discuss a
   complete methodology that encompasses different video-tutorials and
   virtual laboratory-guided practical classes. These technological
   resources have been selected based on the following criteria: i)
   adequacy, of the proposal to the context, available resources and
   students profile; ii) coherence, understood as the congruence between
   proposed actions and scope of each activity; iii) functionality, of the
   planned activities in order to solve specific needs; iv) relevance,
   since the proposed activities must cover an important spectrum able to
   give answers to detected needs; v) sufficiency, understood as the level
   of achieved development on the bases of some defined minimums of quality
   and quantity; and vi) satisfaction, given that students must feel
   comfortable in the balance of preliminary expectative, employed efforts
   and achieved results.},

Title = {No-Reference Multi-Level Video Quality Assessment Metric for
   3D-Synthesized Videos},
Journal = {IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON BROADCASTING},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAY 21},
Abstract = {The visual quality of 3D-synthesized videos is closely related to the
   development and broadcasting of immersive media such as free-viewpoint
   videos and six degrees of freedom navigation. Therefore, studying the
   3D-Synthesized video quality assessment is helpful to promote the
   popularity of immersive media applications. Inspired by the texture
   compression, depth compression and virtual view synthesis polluting the
   visual quality of 3D-synthesized videos at pixel-, structure-and
   content-levels, this paper proposes a Multi-Level 3D-Synthesized Video
   Quality Assessment algorithm, namely ML-SVQA, which consists of a
   quality feature perception module and a quality feature regression
   module. Specifically, the quality feature perception module firstly
   extracts motion vector fields of the 3D-synthesized video at pixel-,
   structure-and content-levels by combining the perception mechanism of
   human visual system. Then, the quality feature perception module
   measures the temporal flicker distortion intensity in the no-reference
   environment by calculating the self-similarity of adjacent motion vector
   fields. Finally, the quality feature regression module uses the machine
   learning algorithm to learn the mapping of the developed quality
   features to the quality score. Experiments constructed on the public
   IRCCyN/IVC and SIAT synthesized video datasets show that our ML-SVQA is
   more effective than state-of-the-art image/video quality assessment
   methods in evaluating the quality of 3D-Synthesized videos.},

Abstract = {Two experiments investigated whether studying a text with an
   ``explanation intention{''} and then actually explaining it to
   (fictitious) other students in writing, would yield the same benefits as
   previously found for explaining on video. Experiment 1 had participants
   first studying a text either with the intention to explain it to others
   or to complete a test, and subsequently restudying vs. explaining in
   writing. Neither study intention nor explaining affected learning
   outcomes. Experiment 2 directly compared explaining in writing and on
   video. Participants studied a text with a test intention followed by
   restudy, or study with an explanation intention followed by either
   explaining in writing or on video. Explaining on video, but not in
   writing, enhanced learning more than restudy. These findings suggest
   that the benefits of explaining on video are not a result of engaging in
   explanation per se. Results are discussed in light of feelings of social
   presence. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

   the significant need for multimedia techniques and systems. It is
   difficult, however, to implement the interactions among the students

   multimedia system for distance learning of higher education with several
   novel characteristics. First, a hierarchical structure for multimedia
   system has been proposed to support personalized learning and teaching
   styles. Second, several feature selection algorithms have been used to
   support fast video classification and retrieval. Third, a novel
   asynchronous model has been provided to address the challenges issues of
   interaction in distance education. We analyze the performance of the
   system based on a real application of the self-study multimedia web page

Abstract = {Educational videos on digital platforms are an attractive way of
   learning, especially for the younger generation, as they provide easy,
   personalizable access to a wide variety of content. Allowing for
   simplified explanations and visual demonstrations, educational videos
   are highly suitable for scientific content. With 500 h of video content
   uploaded per minute, YouTube is the most used user-generated video
   content platform worldwide. This study provides an initial insight into
   the elements which influence the perceived quality of educational
   science videos by viewers, with a special focus on natural science
   videos. In response to a call for study participants via various German
   natural science and technology YouTube and Instagram channels, over
   5,000 participants between the ages of 9 to 72 (M = 18, SD = 8.78)
   completed a web questionnaire. The questionnaire focused on the
   participants' viewing behaviors and their self-perception of the
   importance of the content-creator controlled variables.It was found that
   there are six key elements for a successful educational YouTube video:
   1) structure, 2) reliability, 3) quality, 4) community integration, 5)
   presenter, 6) topic. Based on these elements, a checklist with 17
   recommendations for the creation of successful educational videos was
   developed, serving as a practical guideline for content creators.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Legal regulations call for ``Interprofessional resp.
   interdisciplinary collaboration{''} of several health professions.
   Nevertheless, this educational assignment is rarely implemented in
   current curricula. At the University Hospital Jena, we developed a novel
   and innovative constructivistic-based teaching concept. We selected an
   interprofessional treatment situation from the field of early
   rehabilitation medicine as learning opportunity.
   Methods: The teaching concept consists of 4 steps: (1) Reactivation of
   knowledge regarding disease, early rehabilitation and communication. (2)
   experiential learning exercise: controlled experience of
   interprofessional treatment situation (= learning opportunity) in a role
   play with the opportunity to change perspective, (3) structured
   reflection of the own performance based on a - video record of the role
   play, (4) purposeful transfer of the reflection into one's own daily
   professional behaviour. Based on this concept, a seminar for students
   and trainees, was developed. The core element of this innovative
   teaching concept is a new didactic tool: the interprofessional role play
   with ``video-based self-reflection{''}. The participants were divided
   into small groups, to produce a training film of a selected treatment -
   situation, in our case the mobilization of a patient with an insult
   respectively after hip joint replacement. Subsequently the participants
   were encouraged to reflect their professional, interprofessional and
   communication performance as documented in the video and to transfer the
   new insights into their daily professional activities. Evaluation
   focused on the assessment of personal growth and increase in experience
   and was obtained in writing and during informal - discussion.
   Results: This interprofessional seminar was realised for 3 times in the
   first round (trainees for physiotherapy and nursing). The seminar
   received positive evaluations from all participants in terms of a high
   individual increase of experience and insight through the use of the new
   tool ``video-based self-reflection{''} in the interprofessional
   training.
   Conclusion: The constructivistic teaching approach including the use of
   the role play with following video-based reflection represents a very
   unique individual learning opportunity resulting in a high subjectively
   perceived increase of experience and insight. However, there is a need
   to develop better tools to assess a subjective change of attitude.},

Title = {Learning From Instructional Videos: Learner Gender Does Matter; Speaker
   Gender Does Not},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {12},
Month = {MAY 28},
Abstract = {One crucial design characteristic of auditory texts embedded in
   instructional videos is the speaker gender, which has received some
   attention from empirical researcher in the recent years. Contrary to the
   theoretical assumption that similarity between the speaker's and the
   learner's gender might positively affect learning outcomes, the findings
   have often been mixed, showing null to contrary effects. Notwithstanding
   the effect on the outcomes, a closer look at how the speaker's gender
   and speaker-learner similarities further determine cognitive variables,
   such as different cognitive load types, is overdue. Moreover, on the
   part of the learner, the role of situational interest in the learning
   topic that might be gender related has been neglected so far. Therefore,
   this study explored the role of speaker and learner gender and their
   interaction regarding learning outcomes. We broaden our perspective by
   investigating the effects of gender-related differences concerning
   situational interest in the topic being taught and by determining
   different types of cognitive load. In a 2 (female/male speaker) x 2
   (female/male learner) within- and between-subject design, 95 students
   learned about female and male human sexual maturity with an
   instructional video containing auditory explanations. Analysis results
   indicate that speaker gender and speaker-learner gender similarity had
   no impact on learning gains, situational interest, and cognitive load
   types. However, the results demonstrate that learner's gender,
   especially for the topic of female sexual maturity, matters the most in
   line with the assessed variables. Compared with males, females had
   higher learning gains, reported higher interest in the topic, and
   invested more germane cognitive resources. Thus, instructional designers
   may want to consider learner gender-dependent interest and how it can be
   triggered when creating videos with auditory explanations.},

Abstract = {A convergent parallel mixed methods study investigated the potential of
   one teacher preparation approach for promoting candidate reflection.
   Thirteen candidates participated in clinical field experiences and four
   corresponding seminar classes with guided video analysis activities.
   Candidates were systematically guided through focusing on others before
   focusing on self and explicitly learned about a reflection continuum
   using an instructional framework to build prerequisite skills and
   ultimately improve reflective abilities. Results of paired-sample t
   tests indicated candidates demonstrated significantly higher reflective
   ability scores over time as measured by a reflection checklist.
   Qualitative analysis of structured interviews revealed candidates felt
   activities were (a) a systematic approach to authentic growth, (b) a
   challenging approach to necessary self-confrontation, and (c) allowed
   for connections between self and other. Methodological triangulation was
   used to validate the findings. Implications for teacher preparation
   research and practice are discussed.},

Abstract = {We developed a blended learning approach using the popular video game
   Minecraft to aid in experiential learning of STEM subjects for young
   learners. This approach is low-cost but highly effective due to the use
   of freely available online tools and a high level of interactivity. Two
   teams of geographically separated learners were chosen to work together
   to best illustrate this approach. They worked collaboratively using a
   combination of real-time and delayed-time online tools. The result of
   their collaboration was delivered as two-hour Minecraft build battle
   sessions for seven groups of young participants. Feedback from the
   participants and their parents revealed their satisfaction with the
   activity and was used in self-assessment and critique of the learning
   experience for the learners. This paper describes the technology and
   methodology used in developing this blended learning approach aimed at
   augmenting traditional approaches to teaching and learning of STEM
   subjects.},

Title = {Capturing and displaying microscopic images used in medical diagnostics
   and forensic science using 4K video resolution - an application in
   higher education},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MICROSCOPY},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {260},
Number = {2},
Pages = {175-179},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {To analyze, interpret and evaluate microscopic images, used in medical
   diagnostics and forensic science, video images for educational purposes
   were made with a very high resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels (4K), which
   is four times as many pixels as High-Definition Video (1920 x 1080
   pixels). The unprecedented high resolution makes it possible to see
   details that remain invisible to any other video format. The images of
   the specimens (blood cells, tissue sections, hair, fibre, etc.) are
   recorded using a 4K video camera which is attached to a light
   microscope. After processing, this resulted in very sharp and highly
   detailed images. This material was then used in education for classroom
   discussion. Spoken explanation by experts in the field of medical
   diagnostics and forensic science was also added to the high-resolution
   video images to make it suitable for self-study.
   Lay Description 4K video (4K UHD) offers lifelike video images. The
   unprecedented high resolution of 4096 x 2160 pixels is at least four
   times sharper than High-Definition TV and makes it possible to see
   details that remain invisible to any other video format. In combination
   with perfect sound, this provides a unique viewing and listening
   experience that is almost like entering a new kind of reality. 4K video
   makes new applications possible, for instance, in cinema, education,
   telepresence, gaming, visualization, science and medical diagnostics and
   - research. In a project with 4K video applications in higher education,
   we investigated the possibilities of using this technique for examining
   microscopic slides used in medical laboratory diagnostics and forensic
   science. For example, examination of blood smears, hair and fibres. For
   this purpose, we attached a 4K digital video camera to a light
   microscope to make 4K images. The added value of using 4K video to look
   at these microscopic slides is mainly in the sharp and detailed image
   that 4K video provides after zooming, unlike traditional video
   recording. 4K video also offers the possibility to go from global to
   detail without loss of sharpness, which is very important in this type
   of application. The ability to evaluate these slides is very important
   and requires much practice for students. 4K video images can be used
   during a class discussion. After adding expert comments to the video
   images by the teacher, it can also be used by the students for
   self-study. The 4K video technique enables our students to analyze,
   interpret and evaluate the microscopic slides by using very
   high-resolution images, which were not available until now.},

Title = {Older adults and use of video games},
Journal = {INNOVATION-THE EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SOCIAL SCIENCE RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 5},
Abstract = {Digital technologies are having a profound impact on all aspects of our
   lives and are driving major societal changes. The use of information and
   communication technologies in education is one of the fastest developing
   areas of research, but there is still a digital divide and a need for
   action in lifelong learning to empower older adults. Our aim was to
   understand the profile of older adults who use videogames and to
   identify the factors behind their use and their relationship with
   certain aspects of health and well-being (self-perceived health status,
   cognitive and physical functioning, psychological and social
   well-being). With this aim, we assessed the use and acceptance of
   different types of technology and how these might be influenced by
   different factors, such as older adults' age, gender and level of
   education. Results obtained suggest that there are significant
   differences between the frequency of video game use and age, gender,
   educational level and previous experience with digital technology, but
   no significant differences by gender were found in overall technology
   use. In conclusion, this study could contribute to the design of
   lifelong learning approaches for older people that can take advantage of
   the benefits offered by video games and other technologies to leave no
   one behind.},

Title = {Competency development of pre-service teachers during video-based
   learning: A systematic literature review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {199},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Video-based learning (VBL) has received increasing attention from
   researchers and educators in facilitating professional development (PD)
   for pre-service teachers (PSTs) in technology-enhanced ways. While a
   variety of VBL activities have been incorporated to address PSTs'
   reflective learning, a paucity of research concerns the effects of VBL
   activities on developing PSTs' professional competencies. Using a
   systematic literature review and meta-analysis, this research first
   identifies knowledge and competencies learning outcomes, followed by
   examining the overall effects of VBL activities on PSTs' development of
   content knowledge (CK), pedagogical knowledge (PK), psychological
   characteristics, and generic competencies. A total of 30 empirical
   studies that have reported available statistics to compute effect size
   were identified, involving 2161 PSTs, which allowed for comparisons of
   74 effect sizes. There was a medium effect size in favor of VBL on PSTs'
   CK, with Hedges's g = 0.53 (p <.01) in random effects model; a small to
   medium effect size on PK, with Hedges's g = 0.38 (p <.001) in fixed
   effect model; and a medium effect size on psychological characteristics,
   with Hedges's g = 0.50 (p <.001) in random effects model. Our analysis
   of categorical moderators revealed the moderating effects of
   collaboration mode, video content, and video length simultaneously
   occur. These findings suggested a competency model through the analysis
   of the synthesized literature on VBL learning outcomes. The model
   provides insights into how VBL activities should be designed and
   assessed for PSTs' PD.},

Abstract = {Since the launch of the European Higher Education Area in March 2010,
   the life of students has become busier each year. The number of tasks,
   group works, practices and partial examinations to pass has
   progressively increased. Moreover, the need to enhance their
   competitiveness with respect to other students (e.g., by learning second
   languages or attending specialisation courses) makes the time they
   allocate for studying to be more and more fragmented and dispersed in
   time.
   The present study analyses the use of videos as learning material during
   the course, to complement the conventional teaching methodology. These
   videos allow students to visualise brief theoretical explanations and
   practical examples at any time and place through the YouTube platform.
   In this way, the students may self-manage their available time and
   decide their studying schedule with more flexibility. Also, they have
   the possibility to study even when they do not have their notes
   available for consultation.
   Some videos consist of a presentation made with Microsoft PowerPoint
   together with the off-screen explanation of the teacher, while others
   show lab facilities or hand-written examples resolution. The videos were
   published within a specific YouTube channel and in an Open Course Ware
   (OCW), designed as a repository of teaching videos in the platform of
   the University of Zaragoza. This video collection was complemented with
   a set of short self-assessment questionnaires to support the learning
   process through this methodology.
   The results show a high degree of satisfaction among students with this
   teaching methodology, as well as an improvement in the learning
   outcomes. According to the visualization statistics, the most suitable
   maximum duration of the videos should be in the range of 10 minutes to
   increase the number of views and the retention of the user. Besides,
   from the point of view of the teaching staff, the development of videos
   implies the possibility of seeing how other teachers explain the
   subject, being especially useful in the case of teachers who have to
   teach the subject for the first time.
   The study is framed within several subjects in the field of
   thermodynamics and thermal engineering, from various Bachelor's degrees
   of the University of Zaragoza. This article is mostly focused on the
   results obtaining in the Degree in Electronic and Automatic Engineering.
   The teaching innovation project is funded by the Vice-rectorate for
   Academic Policy of the University of Zaragoza (PRAUZ\_18\_012 and

Title = {Effects of a social regulation-based online learning framework on
   students' learning achievements and behaviors in mathematics},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {160},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Most university degrees often require students to demonstrate
   proficiency in mathematics, which is the basic requirement in many
   fields, such as science, engineering, or technology. Mathematical
   knowledge is so common as to be essential in higher education. Although
   mathematical skills are crucial to the success of study in many domains,
   a large number of students are not willing to study related courses.
   Anxiety and pressure triggered by previous failures in mathematic
   learning are considered as the reason. The online learning environment
   provides students with opportunities to exchange opinions with others
   and facilitate their self-regulated learning. Scholars believe that the
   learning performances of students can be enhanced if they make reference
   to other students' learning strategies during the study process. The
   practice of making references to other students' learning strategies and
   mutually monitoring each other during the study process is called social
   regulation. The study efficiency of social regulation in learning
   mathematics will need to be verified. This study has adopted a social
   regulation-based online learning approach for assisting students in
   achieving learning goals with peers' power. At the same time, this study
   conducted an experiment with an experimental group and a control group.
   The social regulationbased online learning approach was used by the
   experimental group while the conventional selfregulated learning
   approach was used by the control group. According to the results, the
   social regulation-based online learning approach enhances students'
   learning achievements and learning motivations in mathematics. Based on
   the results of the sequential pattern analysis for investigating the
   online learning behaviors of the two groups of students, students who
   use the social regulation-based online learning approach have more
   positive online learning behaviors, such as reading the supplementary
   materials regarding the wrongly answered questions and revising the
   notes. On the contrary, students who use the conventional self-regulated
   learning approach only pay attention to the results of tests and
   feedback provided by their teacher. They seldom have behaviors of
   looking at the supplementary materials, adding or deleting notes. With
   the above verification, the developed system of this study not only
   enhances students' learning performances, but also guides them to have
   more meaningful learning behaviors in mathematics.},

Abstract = {Based on the profound changes in the teaching methodology and learning
   assessment that has meant for teaching faculty staff implementing Higher
   Education Area (EHEA), from the research group Education and Citizenship
   of the Balearic Islands University was presented, for the current
   academic year 2012-2013, a teaching innovation project (awarded and
   funded by the Education Sciences Institute of the same university) based
   on the proposal of an educational activity-evaluative addressed to first
   year students at the Faculty of Social Work Degree. This activity was
   part of the content provided through a compulsory curriculum entitled
   ``Documentation and Scientific Communication{''}, focused on acquiring
   and improving information skills of university students: identifying
   information needs, locating and evaluating academic information sources,
   the information management and communication and dissemination of new
   knowledge, once generated, through academic work. In order to enhance
   both the involvement of students in their own learning process, such as
   the acquisition of knowledge involved through self-employment (essential
   in the new undergraduate) students raised the production of two video
   tutorials (one initial, preliminary development of course content, and a
   final, after all the teaching /learning and performed at the end of the
   academic semester) based search and localization of three scientific
   papers in electronic form. This activity, in fact, has become a tool for
   assessing the teaching methodology, based on the evaluation and
   assessment of student learning and focus on the level of understanding
   of course content, while it has another element of the learning tutoring
   throughout the semester, through monitoring of the work of students and
   consultation. Thus, the proposed activity (and presented in this work,
   together with the results obtained from it) has allowed, on one side, a
   scale of search skills and location of students' academic documentation
   (through delineation of different dimensions to be analyzed for
   assessing the resulting video tutorials) and secondly, has served for
   the evaluation of the students meaningful learning, and for the
   detection of possible improvements and potential teachers modifications
   of the subject content in which the activity is limited.},

Title = {Teaching and learning speech and language therapy skills: the
   effectiveness of classroom as clinic in speech and language therapy
   student education},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF LANGUAGE \& COMMUNICATION DISORDERS},
Year = {2004},
Volume = {39},

Abstract = {Background: Terms such as `clinical intuition' have often been applied
   to the practice of speech and language therapy. Various authors have
   aimed to make the process of therapy practice more explicit, and it is
   argued that recently developed descriptive/analytic frameworks have the
   potential to engender the critical mindset necessary for student speech
   and language therapists to become good reflective practitioners, with
   the potential for enhancing clinical education.
   Aims: To investigate whether and how aspects of clinical skills
   education could be usefully addressed in an academic, as opposed to a
   clinical, setting. The study aimed to address the question of whether
   use of an interaction analysis system, in conjunction with video
   observation, and `practice simulation' in a teaching-learning programme
   could be shown to have a positive impact on: (1) students' perceptions
   of their own understanding and practice of therapy, and their
   perceptions of themselves as self-reflective practitioners; and whether
   (2) this was borne out by students' ability to observe and interpret
   therapeutic interaction, as measured by (i) an objective written
   assessment; (ii) an objective video observation assessment; and (iii)
   assessment of their abilities in clinical practice.
   Methods \& Procedures: Thirty-six students from City University took
   part in an experimental, placebo-controlled study using a deferred
   intervention design. Assessments designed to reflect changes resulting
   from the teaching-learning curriculum were carried out pre- and
   post-intervention with experimental and control groups. Quantitative and
   qualitative results were obtained.
   Outcomes \& Results: The intervention programme was found to have had a
   significant impact on students' perceptions of their understanding of
   therapy, but not on their perceptions of their practice of therapy. The
   experimental group scored significantly better on a written assessment
   of `interpretation of therapy interaction', but were no better than the
   control group on a `Video observation' assessment. Owing to attrition
   and the poor quality of videos submitted for assessment, it was not
   possible to measure changes in actual clinical practice. Qualitative
   feedback from the teaching-learning programme suggests that students
   generally found the approach to be beneficial.
   Conclusions: While there were some encouraging results, it is still
   uncertain whether addressing the actual practice of therapy in an
   academic setting gives `added value' to the work carried out on clinical
   placements. However, there is no doubt that bringing this type of
   programme under the umbrella of an academic institution would greatly
   increase the consistency of teaching and the range of experiences
   available to students.},

Abstract = {Machine-learning-based stress detection systems differ with respect to
   the ground truth used for training the algorithms. It is unclear how
   models trained on different facets of the stress reaction (e.g.,
   biological, psychological, social) can be compared, interpreted and
   applied. In this study, we investigate the influence of the stress label
   on the performance of machine learning models trained on either vocal
   characteristics or facial expressions extracted from videos. We
   collected videos from 40 male participants while being exposed to the
   Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) and assessed self-reported, live
   observed, video-annotated and neuro-endocrinological stress levels. We
   train three standard machine learning models to separately predict
   different stress labels using either voice or facial cues. Analyzing the
   relationships of different stress facets we found that observers'
   annotations were significantly positively associated (live vs. video
   annotated, rho(s) = .53). Similarly, the neuro-endocrinological stress
   indices correlated with each other (cortisol vs. sAA , rho(s) = .39).
   Machine learning experiments resulted in predictions that were
   positively associated with panel-annotated stress levels showing
   significantly stronger correlations in voice-based models (rho(s) = .54
   vs. rho(s)= .30). Predictions of self-reported stress were positively
   related to ground truth values for face-based (rho(s) = .24) but not for
   voice-based models. There was no evidence for successful predictions of
   video-annotations or endocrinological stress levels in both settings. We
   provide evidence that machine learning models trained on different
   stress assessments perform differently and should be interpreted and
   applied accordingly. Implications and recommendations for future work on
   video-based stress detection are discussed.},

Abstract = {The need for research-based instructional support for culturally and
   linguistically diverse students with reading difficulties is a national
   priority. In this rural Hawaii study, teachers and parents selected four
   first-grade students who were experiencing delays in reading fluency and
   comprehension skills to receive tutoring and video self-modeling
   interventions. Two students were identified as having specific learning
   disabilities, one as being developmentally delayed, and one was in the
   process of being referred for special education. Community partners were
   trained to provide tutoring with the 25-step ACE reading protocol. Two
   2-minute self-modeling videotapes were constructed: the first depicted
   the student fluently reading a passage; the second showed the student
   applying a story map and successfully answering comprehension questions.
   A multiple-baseline design across two behaviors (reading fluency and
   comprehension) was used to observe the effect of each intervention on
   reading fluency and comprehension skills. Reading fluency, measured in
   number of correct words per minute, doubled for three students and
   quadrupled for the fourth by the end of eight weeks. Reading
   comprehension, measured in number of correct responses, reached
   pre-established criteria. Viewing the self-modeling videotapes was
   associated with reduced variability and maintenance of increased
   performance. Follow-up indicated that gains maintained for six months.
   Teachers and parents reported generalization to classroom and home.},

Abstract = {Despite the popularity of MOOCs in providing opportunities for
   socialization, collaboration, and professional improvement, there has
   been little research exploring them in the context of Software
   Engineering Education (SEE). The purpose of this study is to provide a
   better understanding of practices and challenges when developing
   academic software engineering MOOCs. To this end, we research (i) how
   MOOCs in SEE are designed and (ii) what learning design considerations
   educators and learning designers have when developing SEE-related MOOCs.
   To address the first research question, a systematic mapping is
   performed to outline the current landscape. The second research question
   is answered by analyzing and reflecting on practical experiences
   acquired during the design of a MOOC on Agile Software Development. The
   design of the course was based on the Pedagogical Design Pattern
   Framework for MOOCs, an approach to design for learning that was defined
   in our previous studies. For this course, two environments were
   considered: (a) course-time on the Tim Tec MOOC platform for deeper
   engagement with active learning activities, such as Project-based
   learning; (b) a Facebook group as a social and collaborative learning
   space, including scenarios based on problem-based learning to activate
   prior knowledge. Some of the pedagogical strategies adopted to motivate
   self-regulated learning included self-introduction video, diary,
   diagnostic self-assessments, development of small projects alone and in
   pairs. Our findings provide evidence that there are still several
   technological and pedagogical challenges that need to be addressed so as
   to enhance the MOOCs learning experience for SEE. Technological issues
   identified include the development of tools and educational games, which
   should be integrated into MOOCs, and the use of learning analytics to
   support motivation, user experience, and more active learning in
   specific topics, such as Project Management, Agile Methods, and
   Requirements Engineering. In turn, the most significant and needed
   improvement to the pedagogical aspects is a re-thinking of the virtual
   moment in the MOOC platform so as to optimize it through activities that
   promote active learning and contextualized assessments.},

Abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task in computer vision. It aims
   to identify incorrect image data patterns which deviate from the normal
   ones. Conventional methods generally address AD by preparing augmented
   negative samples to enforce self-supervised learning. However, these
   techniques typically do not consider semantics during augmentation,
   leading to the generation of unrealistic or invalid negative samples.
   Consequently, the feature extraction network can be hindered from
   embedding critical features. In this study, inspired by visual attention
   learning approaches, we propose CutSwap, which leverages saliency
   guidance to incorporate semantic cues for augmentation. Specifically, we
   first employ LayerCAM to extract multilevel image features as saliency
   maps and then perform clustering to obtain multiple centroids. To fully
   exploit saliency guidance, on each map, we select a pixel pair from the
   cluster with the highest centroid saliency to form a patch pair. Such a
   patch pair includes highly similar context information with dense
   semantic correlations. The resulting negative sample is created by
   swapping the locations of the patch pair. Compared to prior augmentation
   methods, CutSwap generates more subtle yet realistic negative samples to
   facilitate quality feature learning. Extensive experimental and ablative
   evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art AD
   performance on two mainstream AD benchmark datasets.},

Abstract = {This research capitalized on a powerful form of observational learning
   to teach linguistic structures not evident in the expressive language of
   children with developmental delays. Specifically, the effects of
   videotaped self-modeling on the acquisition of new linguistic structures
   used for requesting were investigated. Three preschoolers with
   developmental disabilities were taught semantic relations not present in
   their expressive repertoires. To prepare self-modeling videotapes,
   children first were prompted to imitate specific linguistic structures
   in simulated classroom requesting situations. Editing of the videotapes
   removed prompts to generate examples of competent performance so that
   children could view themselves performing targeted structures as
   requests, correctly and independently. Linguistic performance during
   requesting opportunities was monitored during classroom activities. A
   multiple baseline design across children was used to assess the effects
   of viewing brief, self-modeling videotapes. All 3 children learned their
   goals through self-modeling. Consistent performance during classroom
   activities was not demonstrated, however, until a question (i.e., `'What
   do you need?'') was introduced in the classroom and in two cases after
   videos were viewed in the classroom. Despite these initial
   generalization difficulties, the results indicate videotaped
   self-modeling is potentially effective for teaching children with
   disabilities to use linguistic structures.},

Abstract = {One of the required 21st-century skills necessary to cope with
   challenging tasks in teaching is nurturing active independent learners
   who can perform self-regulated learning (SRL). To support teachers in
   attaining and transferring their newly acquired knowledge and practices
   to real-time teaching in the classroom, an effective professional
   development programme should include authentic environments that enhance
   autonomous learners. We introduce a theoretical-practical model that
   integrates simulations with professional actors (SIM) with SRL
   principles (SIM-SRL). The current study aims to examine the
   contributions of the integrated SIM-SRL model, to leverage training with
   a unique simulative environment supported by metacognitive SRL questions
   and to nurture student-centred practices. In a quasi-experimental study,
   we examined the environmental effects on 113 primary school teachers by
   comparing three groups: SIM-SRL, SIM only, and a control exposed to a
   meaningful learning programme. Video-recorded lessons and
   self-reflections after the lesson revealed four student-centred teaching
   practices that support SRL: knowledge construction, metacognitive
   questions, think-time and collaboration. Results indicated that teachers
   in the SIM-SRL group had significantly higher performance scores,
   followed by the SIM group, which in turn outperformed the control group.
   Implications for professional development programmes are discussed.},

Abstract = {There is wide interest in the potential of `serious' video games as
   vehicles for learning. Especially in the health education domain, there
   are now many reports of the use of video games intended to produce
   changes in players' knowledge, attitudes or behaviors that will transfer
   to `real life' settings outside the context of the game. Real progress
   in this exciting field may be seriously limited by the lack of
   evidentially-based and theoretically driven models for creating learning
   strategies that can be incorporated in game design. In particular, there
   has been little published discussion of how learning strategies should
   be used in game design to maximize the achievement of learning
   objectives that are transferable to criterion settings outside the game.
   This chapter analyses the learning models implicit in health games
   described in the literature, and relates these to established learning
   models in order to illustrate the nature of the gaps between current
   game designs and relevant learning theory and technology. This analysis
   provides a systematic framework for identifying principles of game
   design that are soundly based both in theory and research evidence.
   Examples are provided from recent game designs.},

Abstract = {Video domain adaptation is non-trivial due to video is inherently
   involved with multi-dimensional and multi-modal information. Existing
   works mainly adopt adversarial learning and self-supervised tasks to
   align features. Nevertheless, the explicit interaction between source
   and target in the temporal dimension, as well as the adaptation between
   modalities, are unexploited. In this paper, we propose
   Mix-Domain-Adversarial Neural Network and Dynamic-Modal-Distillation
   (MD-DMD), a novel multi-modal adversarial learning framework for
   unsupervised video domain adaptation. Our approach incorporates the
   temporal information between source and target domains, as well as the
   diversity of adaptability between modalities. On the one hand, for every
   single modality, we mix the frames from source and target domains to
   form mix-samples, then let the adversarial-discriminator predict the mix
   ratio of a mix-sample to further enhance the ability of the model to
   capture domain-invariant feature representations. On the other hand, we
   dynamically estimate the adaptability for different modalities during
   training, then pick the most adaptable modality as a teacher to guide
   other modalities by knowledge distillation. As a result, modalities are
   capable of learning transferable knowledge from each other, which leads
   to more effective adaptation. Experiments on two video domain adaptation
   benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed MD-DMD over
   state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {Sustainable agriculture requires suitable group learning approaches that
   trigger capital assets building. Drawing mainly on face-to-face
   extension, methods and approaches used in sustainable agricultural
   projects aim at triggering learning and capital assets building. To
   target and to reach out to a large number of resource-poor households
   the potential role of media, such as video, has received less attention.
   In Bangladesh, videos on sustainable rice seed practices were developed
   with farmers and then shown in multiple villages. This study reports on
   the contribution of farmer-to-farmer video-mediated group learning to
   capital assets building of women in resource-poor households. Data were
   collected using structured interviews with 140 randomly selected women
   in 28 video villages and 40 women in four control villages in north-west
   Bangladesh. Video-mediated group learning enhanced women's ability to
   apply and experiment with seed technologies. It also stimulated
   reciprocal sharing of new knowledge and skills between them, other
   farmers and service providers. Rice yields increased by 15\%, which
   improved the women's social and economic status and intra-household
   decision-making. Over 20\% of the households attained rice
   self-sufficiency, with no changes observed in control villages. This
   study has provided insights into the potential use of farmer-to-farmer
   video in sustainable agriculture to strengthen human, social and
   financial capital and to reduce poverty.},

   Site: Field work focuses on the development of the educational program
   ``Care is in your hands{''} that takes place in two villages (Primary
   Care. Comarca Araba).
   Participants: Through a theoretical sampling involved people who are in
   a ``mature-adult{''} life stage and three nurses with extensive
   experience in development health education programs.
   Methods: Participant observation where health education sessions are
   recorded in video and group reflection on action. To triangulate the
   data, have been made in-depth interviews with 4:participants. Carried
   out a content and discourse analysis.
   Results: Participant and nurses' Previous Frameworks, and these last
   ones' discourses as well, reveal a current technical rationality
   (unidirectional, informative,.) yet in practice that perpetuates the
   role of passive recipient of care. Educational keys constructed from a
   viewpoint of Dialogic Learning emerge as elements that facilitate

   Conclusions: Dialogical learning emerges as key to the training and
   empowerment, where we have seen how practical-reflexive, and not
   technical, rationality is meanly useful confronting ambiguous and
   complex situations of self-care practice and education. (C) 2014

Abstract = {Traditional methods of health education on dengue fever in schools have
   faced such challenges as finding proper time and place to match
   students' schedules and training potential lecturers. Using video games
   to spread health-related knowledge is an innovative method, which not
   only meet these challenges but also present an effective approach. In
   order to evaluate the effectiveness of a video game, called ``Mosquito
   Defense{''} on dengue-related knowledge among primary and secondary
   school students, 1,311 students from 40 randomly selected classes
   {[}primary (3rd and 5th grades) and secondary (2nd and 5th grades)] in
   12 schools of Guangzhou, PR China were chosen using a multi-stage
   stratified cluster random sampling method. Two classes per enrolled
   grade from these 12 schools were randomly selected and assigned as
   intervention or control group. Students in intervention group were
   provided with Mosquito Defense video game and those in control group
   received reading material containing the same dengue-related knowledge
   for a 20-minute learning period in school or at home. A
   quasi-experimental pre-test and immediate or a one-day delayed post-test
   were employed to compare differences in students' scores using a
   questionnaire, which assessed dengue-related knowledge and attitudes.
   Students in intervention groups have significantly higher improvement of
   scores on dengue-related knowledge than those in control groups
   (p-<0.001), although scores of both groups are significantly increased
   following access to both types of learning tools (p<0.001 respectively).
   These results were consistent across different regions (rural or urban)
   and places of learning (school or home). Students with lower pre-test
   scores on dengue knowledge or more positive attitudes towards the
   learning tool were more likely to show greater improvement in post-test
   scores (OR = 0.95; 95\% CI: 0.92-0.98 and OR = 1.05; 95\% CI: 1.02-1.08,
   respectively). Univariate logistic regression analysis indicated
   students who succeeded in the video game were more likely to have higher
   improvement in dengue knowledge scores than those who failed (OR = 2.15;
   95\% CI: 1.08-4.24). The majority (70.7\%) of participants would like to
   learn health knowledge through the medium of video games. Thus, Mosquito
   Defense video game could be an innovative method for improving
   dengue-related knowledge among primary and secondary school students.},

Abstract = {This empirical study investigated hospitality management students'
   perceptions of simulation-based learning within the framework of the
   technology acceptance model (TAM). To assess participants' perceptions
   of simulation-based learning (SBL), a questionnaire was formulated based
   on prior research to address computer self-efficacy (CSE), perceived
   ease of use (PEU), Perceived usefulness (PU), attitude (A), intention to
   use (IU), and frequency of use (FU). Roughly 805 participants from the
   U.S. and Canada took part in this study. Collected data were analyzed
   using SmartPLS; results revealed that CSE is a significant predictor of
   PEU and PU. Study outcome further illustrated that PEU has a significant
   impact on PU, A, and FU. Also, IU is directly influenced by PU and A.
   Theoretical and practical implications are also included in this study.},

Abstract = {In recent years student exposure to computer applications has increased
   at an unprecedented rate. Yet the use of these promising technologies in
   education remains in its infancy. The growing practice of `gamification'
   offers today's educators the means of conveying their lessons in a more
   engaging way, by utilising computer game mechanics. However, many of
   these learning tools have not been empirically evaluated. This research
   investigated the development of a desktop computer application, to
   replace an existing learning resource, a video, currently used by over
   700 life sciences students a year in one of the top 100 universities of
   the world. The interactive game presents the same essential information
   as the video, on key anatomical features of mammalian skulls, and
   provides student self-testing. Results from a two-treatment, pre- and
   post-intervention experimental design suggest the new product is better
   for providing both knowledge acquisition and a positive learning
   experience. Nevertheless, the results are unlikely to be statistically
   significant. Insights from the findings are discussed and directions for
   future research are given.},

Title = {Supervisors' and residents' patient-education competency in challenging
   outpatient consultations},
Journal = {PATIENT EDUCATION AND COUNSELING},
Year = {2015},
Volume = {98},
Number = {9},
Pages = {1084-1091},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Objectives: We compared supervisors' and residents' patient-education
   competency in challenging consultations in order to establish whether
   supervisors demonstrate sufficient patient-education competency to act
   credibly as role models and coaches for residents.
   Methods: All consultations conducted at one, two, or three of the
   outpatient clinics of each of the participating physicians were videoed.
   Each participant selected two challenging consultations from each clinic
   for assessment. We assessed their patient-education competency using the
   CELI instrument, we calculated net consultation length for all videoed
   consultations and we measured patient opinion about the patient
   education received using a questionnaire.
   Results: Forty-four residents and fourteen supervisors participated in
   the study. They selected 230 consultations for assessment. On average,
   supervisors and residents demonstrated similar patient-education
   competency. Net consultation length was longer for supervisors. Patient
   opinion did not differ between supervisors and residents.
   Conclusions: Supervising consultants generally do not possess sufficient
   patient-education competency to fulfill their teaching roles in
   workplace-based learning that is aimed at improving residents'
   patient-education competency.
   Practice implications: Not only residents but also supervising
   consultants should improve their patient-education competency.
   Workplace-based learning consisting of self-assessment of and feedback
   on videoed consultations could be useful in attaining this goal. (C)

Title = {The evaluation of synchronous and asynchronous online learning: student
   experience, learning outcomes, and cognitive load},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAR 22},
Abstract = {BackgroundThe abrupt onset of the COVID-19 pandemic compelled
   universities to swiftly establish online teaching and learning
   environments that were not only immediately deployable but also
   conducive to high-quality education. This study aimed to compare the
   effectiveness of the online synchronous and asynchronous teaching
   formats in the dermatology lecture for undergraduate medical students,
   including academic performance, self-efficacy, and cognitive
   load.MethodsA total of 170 fourth-year undergraduate medical students
   attending the dermatology lecture were included. The lecture was
   delivered using both the synchronous method (live online lecture via
   Webex meeting) and the asynchronous method (lecture videos shared on
   YouTube). The students had the freedom to choose their preferred method
   of attending the online lecture. The study assessed three main aspects:
   (1) learning outcomes measured through pretest, posttest, and retention
   test scores; (2) cognitive load experienced by students, including
   mental load and mental effort measured using eight items; and (3)
   satisfaction levels with each online teaching format.ResultsIn this
   study, 70 students opted for the synchronous online lecture, while 100
   students chose the asynchronous online lecture. Both synchronous and
   asynchronous teaching methods exhibited significant improvements in post
   and retention test scores compared to the pretest. Satisfaction levels,
   rated on a scale of 0-5, were generally high for both teaching methods,
   with no significant differences observed (4.6 for synchronous, 4.53 for
   asynchronous; p =.350). Regarding cognitive load, the synchronous method
   showed a significantly lower level than the asynchronous method (p
   =.0001). Subgroup analysis revealed no difference in mental effort (p
   =.0662), but the level of mental load was lower in the synchronous
   method (p =.0005).ConclusionsBoth synchronous and asynchronous online
   teaching methods demonstrated improvements in learning outcomes and high
   levels of student satisfaction. However, the cognitive load experienced
   by students was lower in the synchronous setting compared to the
   asynchronous setting. These findings remind health professions educators
   that they would consider the students' cognitive load when designing
   online curricula.},

Title = {Capturing self-regulated learning processes in virtual reality: Causal
   sequencing of multimodal data},
Journal = {BRITISH JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 30},
Abstract = {This study examines the embodied ways in which learners monitor their
   cognition while learning about exponential functions in an immersive
   virtual reality (VR) based game, Pandemic by Prisms of Reality.
   Traditionally, metacognitive monitoring has been assessed through
   behavioural traces and verbalised instances. When learning in VR,
   learners are fully immersed in the learning environment, actively
   manipulating it based on affordances designed to support learning,
   offering insights into the relationship between physical interaction and
   metacognition. The study collected multimodal data from 15 participants,
   including think-aloud audio, bird's-eye view video recordings and
   physiological data. Metacognitive monitoring was analysed through
   qualitative coding of the think-aloud protocol, while movement was
   measured via optical flow analysis and cognitive load was assessed
   through heart rate variability analysis. The results revealed embodied
   metacognition by aligning the data to identify learners' physical states
   alongside their verbalised metacognition. The findings demonstrated a
   temporal interplay among cognitive load, metacognitive monitoring, and
   motion during VR-based learning. Specifically, cognitive load, indicated
   by the low- and high-frequency heart rate variability index, predicted
   instances of metacognitive monitoring, and monitoring predicted
   learners' motion while interacting with the VR environment. This study
   further provides future directions in understanding self-regulated
   learning processes during VR learning by utilizing multimodal data to
   inform real-time adaptive personalised support within these
   environments.Practitioner notesWhat is already known about this
   topicImmersive virtual reality (VR) environments have the potential to
   offer personalised support based on users' individual needs and
   characteristics.Self-regulated learning (SRL) involves learners
   monitoring their progress and strategically regulating their learning
   when needed.Multimodal data captured during VR learning, such as
   birds-eye-view video, screen recordings, physiological changes and
   verbalisations, can provide insights into learners' SRL processes and
   support needs.What this paper addsProvides insights into the embodied
   aspects of learners' metacognitive monitoring during learning in an
   immersive VR environment.Demonstrates how SRL processes can be captured
   via the collection and analysis of multimodal data, including
   think-aloud audio, bird's-eye view video recordings and physiological
   data, to capture metacognitive monitoring and movement during VR-based
   learning.Contributes to the understanding of the interplay between
   cognitive load, metacognitive monitoring, and motion in immersive VR
   learning.Implications for practice and/or policyResearchers and
   practitioners can use the causal relationships identified in this study
   to identify instances of SRL in an immersive VR setting.Educational
   technology developers can consider the integration of online measures,
   such as cognitive load and physiological arousal, into adaptive VR
   environments to enable real-time personalised support for learners based
   on their self-regulatory needs.},

Abstract = {With the spread of the new Coronavirus, in Brazil, educational
   institutions have suspended face-to-face classes. In this context,
   educators, managers and entire families had to find new ways to learn

   situation, we present, in this article, reflections on online education,
   as a possibility of generating knowledge, in a more participatory,
   dialogical and interactive way, with a view to the training of
   self-employed and author citizens in and beyond pandemic. In addition,
   we suggest an activity for the production of videos and comic stories,
   based on participatory processes, made possible by Online education. In
   this perspective, the production of knowledge is materialized in the
   association between the teacher and the student, and the leading role in
   the learning process occurs in the relationships established between
   these actors and, mainly, with the object of knowledge.},

Abstract = {The use of videos in education has attracted considerable research
   attention. However, in order to gain the most benefits, learners need to
   actively engage with videos. It is an important, yet challenging, task
   to disentangle the relation between engagement with videos and learning,
   and at the same time to take into account relevant individual
   differences in order to offer personalised support. In this paper we
   investigate the question: `Can user characteristics relating to
   self-regulation, knowledge, and experience be leveraged for predicting
   user engagement with videos?'. Our results show that users' domain
   knowledge and self-regulation abilities can inform overall engagement
   prediction (inactive, passive and constructive learners), which makes
   them useful for adaptation and personalisation.},

Abstract = {This chapter explores the seamless learning opportunities that video
   games and virtual reality offer for learners and instructors.
   Interacting with content, with each other, and with learning processes
   in virtual environments, learning becomes a process combined with
   discovery and fun. The authors analyze emerging trends and learning
   understandings (epistemologies) built by video game users and learners
   represented in the forms of avatars. Digital environments are in fact
   transforming the way learners and instructors (faculty) interact with
   each other in and across contexts. Using data from two parallel research
   projects, the chapter examines students' self identity construction,
   problem solving, and learning in virtual environments. The authors
   suggest that learning epistemologies that take place in virtual reality
   should be brought back to the classroom or to the online environment (by
   the instructional designer or the game developer) and impact the way
   learning takes place in this `real'/physical environments.},

Title = {Mood-affect congruency. Exploring the relation between learners' mood

Abstract = {In the educational context, the influences of the emotional charge of
   audiovisual media are rarely investigated. Additionally, the mood of the
   learner influences learning with multimedia. This study aims to
   investigate the influence of both variables on learning with videos.
   Therefore, 162 school students watched educational videos which were
   manipulated in terms of emotional charge. The participants were randomly
   assigned to one cell of a 2 (learners mood: positive vs. negative) x 2
   (emotional charge of the educational video: positive vs. negative)
   between-subjects factorial design. Retention and transfer performance
   were measured in order to examine learning effects. Furthermore, mental
   load, mental effort, and affective variables were collected. Results
   revealed that the mood of the learner did not influence learning
   outcomes and cognitive assessments. The positive emotional charge of the
   video fostered retention performance and led to a reduced mental load.
   Transfer performance was fostered in the conditions with congruence
   between learners mood and the emotional charge of the video. Results are
   discussed by considering the emotion-as-facilitator hypothesis and the
   mood congruency effect},

Abstract = {In this paper, a questionnaire-based survey on the use of online videos
   by undergraduate engineering students for study-related purposes is
   presented. Over the last few years, a large number of instructional
   videos has been uploaded to websites such as YouTube. Due to the
   widespread distribution of high-speed internet connections and (mobile)
   devices, such as smartphones or laptops, which are nowadays routinely
   used by students, online videos are also frequently used in higher
   education. While much research on this subject focuses on Massive Open
   Online Courses (MOOCs) or flipped classroom approaches, this survey
   examines use of videos for self-study, complementary to traditional
   face-to-face courses. Furthermore, we analyze the acceptance of a
   characteristic video production style, which uses specific 3D animations
   to clarify complex connections between technical and mathematical
   aspects. The results indicate extensive use of short videos which
   address subjects that are particularly difficult for the students. This
   survey can help educators to develop an impression of current video use
   by undergraduate engineering students.},

Abstract = {The educational effectiveness of dermoscopy image-based self-learning on
   a computer for medical students has not been well examined. To assess
   the effect of an image-based self-learning session on the dermoscopic
   diagnostic performance for malignant melanoma (MM), basal cell
   carcinoma, melanocytic nevus and seborrheic keratosis (SK) on non-acral
   regions in comparison with a conventional classroom-style lecture, 114
   fourth-year medical students (mean age, 23.7 years; male : female,
   73:41) were enrolled. The subjects were randomly assigned to either a
   self-learning to lecture (SL) or lecture to self-learning (LS) group to
   receive a 15-min image-based self-learning computer session and a 15-min
   video lecture session in different orders. The user interface of the
   digital content was the same as that on a website (). Diagnostic
   performance was determined using the total number of correct answers for
   the four diseases and by malignancy prediction in examination A (before
   training), B (after receiving one session) and C (after receiving both
   sessions). The examinations were all unique and contained five
   dermoscopic images each of the four diseases. The total number of
   correct answers and malignancy prediction results for examination B were
   significantly higher in the SL group than in LS (11.6 and 15.2 vs 10.1
   and 13.4, respectively; bothP < 0.01), with no remarkable differences
   for examination C (13.5 and 16.8 vs 13.3 and 16.4, respectively;P = 0.62
   andP = 0.21). In subanalyses, the number of correct answers for SK in
   examination B was significantly higher in the SL group (3.6 vs. 1.8,P <
   0.01), while that for MM was significantly lower (2.2 vs 3.0,P < 0.01).
   Diagnostic performance was comparable between sexes for examination B.
   In conclusion, computer-assisted dermoscopy image-based self-learning
   may be a suitable and non-inferior alternative to classroom-style
   instruction for medical students within an ultra-short training period.},

Abstract = {The Ministry of Education in Korea provides varied professional
   development programs for public school teachers, but they are mostly
   top-down, institution-centered, one-time offer courses, which seldom
   meet teachers' needs and hardly guarantee improvement of the participant
   teachers' instruction. To solve the repeated problems, this study
   intends to suggest a new reform model for teacher professional
   development by integrating a mobile-based open learning platform, SMART
   Teaching 3.0. SMART is meant to be self-directed, motivating,
   applicable, rich, and technology-supported in this project. The new
   teacher professional development model was constructed and elaborated
   for two years based on Design-Based Research (DBR) approach (Amiel and
   Reeve, 2008) in the cyclic process of four step principles: 1) analysis,
   2) development, 3) testing and refinement, and 4) reflection.
   First of all, the project started with an analysis of 258 Korean English
   teachers' needs to identify the target instruction tasks they want to
   improve. Second, based on the needs analysis, the contents were created
   in the short video formats and sorted by four categories: 1) Teachers'
   stories 2) Tips \& Issues 3) Virtual class tour, and 4) Screen lectures.
   All the participants shown in the videos are English teachers and
   students in their classrooms. The platform was developed with mobile
   friendly technologies such as `responsive web design (RWD). `Third, the
   mobile-based learning platform was implemented to 149 English teachers
   for five months for its validation. Data were collected from various
   sources such as website statistics, comments, weekly journals and
   interviews to investigate whether this new model can reach the reforming
   educational goals of successfully operating the five key features (e.g.
   SMART), as well as of solving problems in the existing programs. During
   the testing period, it was reported that the mobile-based program
   enabled teachers to use the program without time and place constraints.
   Moreover, the participating teachers perceived self-selected contents
   motivating, although they still wanted update and expansion of the
   contents. Some of them immediately applied what they learned to their
   own classes. Meanwhile, the issue of sustainability of self-directed
   learning was raised in the process of implementation. As the last
   sequence of the DBR principles, this study refined the initial design
   and finally suggests a new model, school-based offline community of
   practice (CoP, Lave \& Wenger, 1991) combined with SMART Teaching 3.0.},

   multiple probe design across participants was used to evaluate the
   effects of PTD on initiation of self-instruction. All participants
   learned to self-instruct. Two participants generalized self-instruction
   to two novel settings. Two participants required instruction in two
   settings before generalizing to the third. Three participants
   generalized self-instruction in the presence of a task direction from
   the researcher to a task direction from their classroom teacher in all
   three settings. One participant generalized to a task direction
   presented by the classroom teacher in one setting, but not in the other
   two. All participants maintained self-instruction behaviors assessed 1

Abstract = {Students with extensive support needs often require intensive

   students with extensive support needs can achieve greater independence
   when evidence-based practices are used to teach independent

   self-modeling (VSM) and the system of least prompts (SLP) on independent
   completion of transitional routines for a student with extensive support
   needs in inclusive school settings. Using VSM and SLP, the student
   learned to complete three transitional routines with greater
   independence. Generalization of independent transitioning skills to
   music class was also measured. Results showed a functional relation
   between the VSM and SLP intervention and independent completion of
   transitional routines. The findings of this study provide several
   implications for practice for using VSM and SLP as a combined
   intervention to increase independent transitioning skills for students
   who previously relied on adult assistance to make transitions along with
   general education peers.},

   focus with this paper is on Germany where the schools and most
   universities are public. Rules are related to the past, skills like deep
   functional knowledge, topics memorised in detail and repetitive methods
   have been on top of the educational syllabus. After the trends of
   globalisation, the introduction of the term `Industry 4.0' provocative
   production and automation. All of a sudden industry has been challenged
   globally with new skills and requirements asking the education system to
   support with a more profound skills of graduates being `digital natives'
   per definition. To change a system takes time, infrastructure and
   advanced training. (cf. Catalano, 2019, p.25f)
   What if there is no time for this transformation? In the beginning of
   2020 the Pandemic Covid-19 hit the world and all schools and
   universities been shut for people's safety. It started as a break but
   after a while people figured even arguing about the quality of online
   education versus in-person learning did not help. Remote education was
   the only way to get in contact with students and pure self-learning
   needed to be enriched by more motivating methods. All of a sudden, all
   parties had new roles. Some really felt overstrained and had very little
   experience. To start a mature semester in autumn, and moving from mainly
   remotely to an at least hybrid format for the rest of the year, teachers
   extended their knowledge of digital tools and exchanged it. Over the
   year faculty increased comfort and some approaches seems to remain even
   if all teaching could be in presence. (cf. Boivin et al., 2021, p.27ff)
   Not only the education system was challenged during the pandemic in
   2020/21, the entire world and business world had to adapt. Comparing
   only with the new business requirements of production companies, shows
   that a lot of the skills the students learned in remote sessions will
   remain in business situations (e.g. video conferencing, online
   presentations, self-motivated learning). In addition, the speed of
   change increased and with the penetration of digital transformation
   everywhere, now is the time to change the main structure of curriculars
   adding more profound skill sets in human interaction, practical
   adaptation of skills versus just having knowledge building new
   characters for life-long learning. (cf. Meilleur, 2018)
   The questions are remaining; `What is the role of online-education past
   the pandemic?' `What could be a new setting in education taking the
   learnings from the pandemic Covid-19 to map new requirements from the
   industry and for future jobs?' The paper will not be able to provide one
   clear answer but will provide a good start of research.},

Abstract = {Recently, the usage of 360-degree videos has prevailed in various
   sectors such as education, real estate, medical, entertainment and more.
   The development of the Virtual World ``Metaverse{''} demanded a Virtual
   Reality (VR) environment with high immersion and a smooth user
   experience. However, various challenges are faced to provide real-time
   streaming due to the nature of high-resolution 360-degree videos such as
   high bandwidth requirement, high computing power and low delay
   tolerance. To overcome these challenges, streaming methods such as
   Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (DASH), Tiling, Viewport-Adaptive
   and Machine Learning (ML) are discussed. Moreover, the superiorities of
   the development of 5G and 6G networks, Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) and
   Caching and the Information-Centric Network (ICN) approaches to optimize
   the 360-degree video streaming are elaborated. All of these methods
   strike to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) and Quality of Service
   (QoS) of VR services. Next, the challenges faced in QoE modeling and the
   existing objective and subjective QoE assessment methods of 360-degree
   video are presented. Lastly, potential future research that utilizes and
   further improves the existing methods substantially is discussed. With
   the efforts of various research studies and industries and the gradual
   development of the network in recent years, a deep fake virtual world,
   ``Metaverse{''} with high immersion and conducive for daily life
   working, learning and socializing are around the corner.},

Abstract = {New learning environments drive the implementation of innovative
   strategies in agreement with the new educational model of the European
   Higher Education Area. Accordingly, an innovative exercise to promote
   cross-curricular competencies such as critical thinking, collaborative
   learning and improvement of the information and communication
   technologies and curricular specific competencies is presented in this
   paper. Students produce videos with their proposed solution of a problem
   from the teacher-selected problem sheet, which they have to modify and
   self-resolve. Videos are cell phone recorded and show the students
   explaining their proposed problem solution. The video performances
   indicate that the students were able to increase its motivation.
   Academic final results show that 65.4\% of students showed greater
   interest in the subject after of exercise and its participation rise
   compare to other traditional exercises. The survey answered by the
   students involved in this project points out that cell phone video
   recording media was a useful activity and they consider that the task
   was transferable to other courses. The use of the mobile phone as a
   pedagogical element is a reality today. And it gives us the possibility
   to teach digital competence as well as to increase the motivation and
   participation of the students. Both things we have achieved as we have
   seen in the results. Finally, we have showed that the inclusion of the
   generation of audio-visual material as a teaching tool, using a
   technology that today is available to everyone, is an excellent tool
   that can facilitate the assimilation of diverse concepts in the
   experimental sciences increasing the motivation and participation of
   students. The manuscript reports on a case study carried out at a

Abstract = {Individuals with intellectual disabilities have different needs related
   to both sexual education and sexual development. This is caused by their
   significant limitations in intellectual and adaptive functioning. This
   is especially true for a female, when these limitations raise problems
   caring for herself during her menstrual period. So far, intervention to
   address the inability of a female with intellectual disabilities in
   taking care of themselves during menstruation is more focused on
   delivering medical procedures or manipulating the menstrual cycle
   through the provision of drugs such as the contraceptive pill, but these
   interventions carry a high risk. Therefore, alternative intervention
   such as psychoeducation is preferable because this intervention has a
   low risk. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of
   social stories and video modeling based on social learning theory, and
   used as an intervention program aimed to improve self-care skills on
   menstrual care in female adolescent with mild intellectual disabilities.
   With a single-case study A-B-A design, the mastery of skills on
   menstrual care were determined using three measures: 1) using a modified
   menstrual questionnaire; 2) a test on comprehension of self-care skills
   during menstruation; and 3) a simulation process with two types of
   sanitary pads (with and without wings) that both were tainted with
   artificial blood. The result showed: 1) an increase in the score of
   questionnaires about menstruation; 2) an increase in comprehension on
   the material; and 3) an increased in behavioral care skills during
   menstrual period even when the type of sanitary napkins and the bathroom
   used were different. The intervention program was found to be effective
   to improve the subject's skills and self-care during a menstrual cycle.},

Title = {Students' perception of technology-assisted learning in undergraduate
   medical education - A survey},
Journal = {SOCIAL SCIENCE JOURNAL},

Volume = {52},

Abstract = {The use of technology assisted learning (TAL) has widely increased over
   the last decade. TAL has become a significant part of many universities'
   curriculum delivery or at least a necessity for both teachers and
   learners to aid in the learning process. A learner's attitude toward,
   and acceptance of, training methods are important precursors to the
   success of any educational method, which in turn may be determined by
   factors such as individual learning style, type of technological tool
   available, learner's general perception about using technological
   assistance, technological complexity for use, etc. Although previous
   studies have focused on the influence and effectiveness of technology in
   aiding the teaching-learning process, it is also important to study
   these factors. Therefore, this study was conducted with the objectives
   to identify undergraduate medical and health science students'
   preference for use of various TAL tools, their perception about the
   effectiveness of technology in aiding the learning process, and to
   investigate the influence of learning style on students' perception of
   TAL. This cross-sectional study was conducted as a survey. The survey
   questions were directed toward identifying students' learning style, and
   their perception of TAL. Student volunteers were provided with two
   self-administered questionnaires, the index of learning style (ILS)
   questionnaire (test-retest correlation coefficient 0.7-0.9) and a
   pre-tested questionnaire to measure perception of TAL. Majority of
   students have a strong component of visual learning style, and therefore
   preferred interactive animations and videos to aid in their learning.
   They also demonstrated increased acceptance of TAL as measured in terms
   of their attitude, and perceived knowledge gain. Nevertheless, students'
   perception of TAL and their learning style existed independent of each
   other. (C) 2014 Western Social Science Association. Published by

   to the qualitative and quantitative content analyses point to a stronger
   emotional involvement of teachers who were analyzing a third-party
   video. The emotions are positively correlated to an in-depth analysis of
   situations considered to be critical. Among those teachers analyzing
   personal videos self-worth-related emotions, in particular, impeded an
   in-depth reflection on such situations.},

Abstract = {Background: Research on long-term health conditions indicates that
   adolescents are not actively involved during their medical visits.
   Active involvement is essential because this can help adolescents learn
   how to self-manage their treatment plan. Objective: To co-design a video
   intervention to improve youth question-asking and provider education
   during paediatric diabetes visits. Patient involvement: A
   participatory-led approach was used to co-design the video, through a
   combination of interviews/ focus groups and the establishment of a Youth
   Advisory Group. Methods: First, focus groups and one-to-one interviews
   were held with adolescents, parents and healthcare providers. Second,
   two workshops were held with the Youth Advisory Group, Parent Advisory
   Group and stakeholders on script design. Finally, an iterative
   development of the video took place between the research team,
   videographer, both advisory groups and the steering committee. There
   were three rounds of feedback before the video was finalised. Results:
   Adolescents' content preferences included: 1) message of empowerment; 2)
   managing your diabetes so you can get on with the fun stuff in life; 3)
   Promoting independence; 4) Reasons for not speaking at clinic visits and
   reassurance; 5) Becoming comfortable to speak and ask questions at
   clinic visits; 6) Practical advice on how to ask questions. Formatting
   preferences included that the video should be short, divided into
   segments, with adolescents with diabetes acting in it, and speaking
   directly to the camera. Discussion: Identifying and reflecting
   adolescents' needs and preferences for engagement with healthcare
   providers was critical in the development process. Adolescents'
   participation in the co-design process was pivotal to the acceptability
   of the intervention for adolescents with diabetes. Practical value: The
   intervention may increase adolescents' participation in communication
   and interactions with healthcare providers, which may help them to be
   more active in the self-management of their condition. (c) 2021 The

Abstract = {Many instructional videos in mathematics education target knowledge of
   procedures and algorithms. To design instructional videos that support
   students in a non-algorithmic domain, such as mathematical modeling, we
   developed a framework based on research on heuristic worked examples and
   instructional videos. Because students' perceptions play an important
   role in whether they will engage with a learning resource, our research
   questions focus on the advantages and challenges students perceive when
   they work with an instructional video on mathematical modeling and solve
   a subsequent related modeling problem. Using a video based on the
   developed framework, we conducted an interview study with 14 pairs of
   upper-secondary students. The results of the qualitative text analysis
   showed that the perceived advantages and challenges were related to
   certain design features and to the processes of self-regulated learning
   with the video. The students experienced challenges regarding the
   video's duration, the transfer to a subsequent related modeling problem,
   the absence of a teacher, and self-discipline. Hence, further learner
   support is necessary to guide the transition from working with a video
   to autonomous modeling, such as combining the video with strategic
   instruments and teacher support. In addition, interactive video features
   may be essential, as the students enjoyed how those features involved
   them in the process of watching the video. Overall, the results indicate
   that instructional videos are promising for providing heuristic worked
   examples, offering an innovative approach for teaching and learning
   mathematical modeling.},

Abstract = {Lecture capture videos, a popular type of instructional content used by
   instructors to share course recordings online, play a significant role
   in educational settings. Compared to other educational videos, these
   recordings require minimal time and effort to produce, making them a
   preferred choice for disseminating course materials. Despite their
   numerous benefits, there exists a scarcity of data-driven evidence
   regarding students' use of and engagement with lecture capture videos.
   Most existing studies rely on self-reported data, lacking comprehensive
   insights into students' actual video engagement. This research endeavor
   sought to bridge this gap by investigating university students'
   engagement patterns while watching lecture capture videos. To achieve
   this objective, we conducted an analysis of a large-scale dataset
   comprising over one million rows of video interaction logs. Leveraging
   clustering and process mining methodologies, we explored the data to
   reveal valuable insights into students' video engagement behaviors. Our
   findings indicate that in approximately 60\% of students' video-watching
   sessions, only a small portion of the videos (an average of 7\%) is
   watched. Our results also show that visiting the video page does not
   necessarily mean that the student watched it. This study may contribute
   to the existing literature by providing robust data-driven evidence on
   university students' lecture capture video engagement patterns. It is
   also expected to contribute methodologically to capturing,
   preprocessing, and analyzing students' video interactions in different
   contexts.},

Abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
   case-base learning (CBL) using video on clinical decision-making and
   learning motivation. Methods: This research was conducted between June
   2009 and April 2010 as a nonequivalent control group non-synchronized
   design. The study population was 44 third year nursing students who
   enrolled in a college of nursing, A University in Korea. The nursing
   students were divided into the CBL and the control group. The
   intervention was the CBL with three cases using video. The controls
   attended a traditional live lecture on the same topics. With
   questionnaires objective clinical decision-making, subjective clinical
   decision-making, and learning motivation were measured before the
   intervention, and 10 weeks after the intervention. Results: Significant
   group differences were observed in clinical decision-making and learning
   motivation. The post-test scores of clinical decision-making in the CBL
   group were statistically higher than the control group. Learning
   motivation was also significantly higher in the CBL group than in the
   control group. Conclusion: These results indicate that CBL using video
   is effective in enhancing clinical decision-making and motivating
   students to learn by encouraging self-directed learning and creating
   more interest and curiosity in learning.},

Title = {Instructional design and educational satisfaction for virtual
   environment simulation in undergraduate nursing education: the mediating
   effect of learning immersion},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 12},
Abstract = {Background Schools were closed after the onset of COVID-19, with
   non-face-to-face practices or distance education in nursing education
   replacing video learning or simulation classes in nursing education
   clinical practicum. This led to an increase in interest in virtual
   environment simulation education. While technology-based teaching
   methods might feel new and intriguing to learners, it is necessary to
   evaluate learner satisfaction with such an educational method beyond its
   novelty value. Therefore, this study examined the mediating effect of
   learning immersion on the relationships between instructional design and
   educational satisfaction, for virtual environment simulation. Methods A
   descriptive cross-sectional research design was used. The study sample
   included students in the third or fourth year of the nursing curriculum
   in South Korea. The participants were 164 nursing students, who had an
   experience with virtual environment simulation practices during the past
   year, prior to September 2021. Data were collected using an online
   questionnaire. The questionnaire addressed the characteristics of
   nursing students, instructional design, learning immersion, and
   educational satisfaction. The collected data were analyzed using path
   analysis. Results The indirect effect of the path between instructional
   design and educational satisfaction, mediated through learning immersion
   in virtual environment simulation was found to be significant.
   Furthermore, the direct path was also statistically significant.
   Conclusion Educational content, based on virtual environment simulation,
   should be implemented based on instructional design. It is necessary to
   recognize the importance of instructional design that can promote
   learning immersion in virtual environment simulation, as well as to
   prepare consistent standards for such design.},

Abstract = {Background and Aims: Video laryngoscopes are often used for education
   and training of intubation skills. This study aimed to examine the
   influence of video-assisted guidance and video replay on intubation
   skills of novice anaesthesiologists. Methods: Adult patients of American
   Society of Anesthesiologists physical status grade I-II, with a normal
   airway and scheduled to undergo elective surgical procedures requiring
   general anaesthesia and orotracheal intubation were included in this
   randomised study. Ten trainee anaesthesiologists, with no prior
   experience of performing tracheal intubation were enroled and randomly
   divided into group STD (received traditional learning) and group VL
   (received video-based learning). After initial mannequin training, the
   first seven intubations in patients in both the groups were done under
   supervision. In group VL, in addition to traditional cues, posttracheal
   intubation, the trainee and instructor had a session of video replay to
   discuss the entire process of laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation with
   areas of improvement. For the subsequent 15 intubations in patients, the
   trainees intubated independently using a standard Macintosh blade. The
   primary objective was to compare time required to intubate (TTI) for
   both groups using Mann-Whitney U test. Secondary objectives included
   comparison of difficulty in intubation (using a 5-point Likert scale),
   self-confidence scores (1-10, 10 - most confident), and
   intubation-related trauma. Results: The mean TTI was significantly lower
   in group VL than in group STD - 40s {[}Interquartile range (IQR): 32-50]
   versus 52s {[}IQR: 39-76], P = 0.002. No difference was seen in
   self-assessed confidence levels, rating of difficulty in intubation, and
   airway trauma. Conclusion: Video replay of the intubation process has a
   positive impact on direct laryngoscopy learning.},

Abstract = {There are three types of m-learning: formal, informal, and
   self-directed. Formal learning consists of learning organized by
   triggered notifications and reminders, such as SMS messages asking
   employees to confirm understanding or participation in an event or the
   completion of an assignment. E-Iearning courseware viewed on a mobile
   device also falls into the formal m-learning camp.
   Informal learning includes strategies such as engaging in interactive
   messaging, fostering two-way communication, and soliciting user feedback
   or data collection. Twitter, blogs, Facebook, and other social media are
   considered mediums for informal learning. Lastly, self-directed learning
   consists of user directed learning, reference and performance support
   materials, content and courseware, and media-based content such as
   podcasts or videos (Brink, 2011). A workshop conducted recently by King
   Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dammam city, Saudi
   Arabia discussed the prospects of using mobile phones for educational
   purposes.
   Khaled Al-Sultan, president of the university, said KFUPM would seek
   greater participation of students in the academic process and encourage
   them to look for knowledge and information. ``We want to keep our
   students away from the spoon-feeding system and encourage them to search
   for the knowledge they want from the right sources,{''} he said at the
   conclusion of the workshop (Arab news, 2011). Therefore due to the
   significance to m-learning in university education and other levels of
   education this paper discusses the theories and rationales of m
   learning. The paper will provide literature review of m learning and
   will try to answer some questions such as; what is the concept of
   m-learning? Who would benefit from m learning? What are the tools of m
   learning? What are the theories and philosophies of m-learning. The
   paper will conclude with some suggestions and recommendations.},

Abstract = {On line courses, like face-to-face courses, require some forms of
   assessment. In the context of constructivist philosophy, self-assessmert
   is perhaps the most meaningful form of assessment. This paper will
   demonstrate some practical self-assessment strategies and techniques for
   learners taking web based online courses. These techniques and
   strategies are incorporated in an online course offered at Teachers
   College, Columbia University, which focuses on Hypermedia in Education.
   Making use of digital video, slides, online forms, rubrics, chats and
   reflections, these techniques and strategies have proved to be essential
   for the web-based course's learners to monitor their own learning},

Abstract = {A student-generated multimedia project was introduced into a first-year
   subject for undergraduate information technology students. Teams of
   students interviewed an IT professional in the workplace and
   video-recorded the interview. A survey of students showed statistically
   significant increases in students' self-reported knowledge and skills
   for key learning objectives. A subsequent qualitative analysis of
   student diaries and reflections discovered several contributing factors:
   the iterative nature of the activities that students undertook in order
   to complete the project; the multiple and evolving representations of
   their knowledge as they proceeded through the project; the importance of
   the workplace context in enhancing learning; and the affordance of the
   mobile devices used by the students for capturing this context on video
   and allowing it to be shared with other students. The research findings
   contribute to our understanding of how complex mobile learning projects
   in context-rich environments can contribute to deep learning.},

Abstract = {Background: Online education-al modules support asynchronous E-learning
   and offer several advantages. This multi -in-stitutional pilot study
   describes the experi-ence among nephrology trainees, of using a
   faculty-developed interactive E-curriculum in hemodialysis (HD) and
   examines its im-pact on learner knowledge and satisfaction.Study design:
   A sequential mixed method design was developed for curriculum
   assess-ment, using a survey tool and 1 : 1 interview. Setting and
   participants: Current or recent (within past 2 years) nephrology fellows
   from four U.S. training programs.Materials and methods: After curriculum
   completion, a 6-item survey was administered to all con-veniently
   sampled participants followed by a 1 : 1 interview of a sampled subset.
   Quanti-tative and qualitative data were analyzed us-ing descriptive
   statistics and thematic analy-sis, respectively.Results: 25 participants
   (18 Yale and 7 non-Yale) were recruited. All participants filled a
   6-item Qualtrics survey after curriculum completion; 12/25 were
   interviewed. The majority were 1st (11/25) or 2nd year (8/25) nephrology
   fellows. Most self-identified as visual (11/25) or kinesthetic (11/25)
   learners. 100\% participants agreed to the ease of use and clinical
   applicability of the E-modules; 100\% found the animated videos and
   self-assessment sections valu-able. On a scale of 1 (not comfortable at
   all) to 5 (very comfortable), respondents rated their perceived level of
   knowledge in 6 key competency areas. Means were 2.2 (range: 2.08 - 2.6)
   pre-intervention and 4.1 (range: 4.0 - 4.32) post-intervention,
   representing a significant increase (p-value = 0.0001). Ani-mated videos
   were the most desired feature of the curriculum. Standardization,
   repeti-tion, a controlled learning environment, and flexibility were
   identified as key advantages of an E-curriculum. Need for a self
   -motivat-ed learner and lack of collaborative learning were its
   limitations.Conclusion: Our study highlights the effectiveness of an
   asynchro-nous E-curriculum in promoting active learn-ing in nephrology
   and provides a framework for E-curricula development. Further study is
   needed to assess its impact on changes in learner attitude and patient
   outcomes. Introduction Internet-based learning (E-learning) is an
   evolving pedagogical approach in nephrolo-gy education to promote
   active, learner -cen-tered distance education {[}1]. E-learning can be
   synchronous (a group of learners engaged simultaneously in real time,
   e.g., web con-ferences) or asynchronous (online modules, podcasts etc.
   where learners access material individually without real-time
   interaction).},

Abstract = {The increased use of Information and Communication Technologies in
   higher education has allowed to support and enhance the
   teaching-learning processes. It also has favoured the widespread
   development of Open Educational Resources (OER), including the Open
   Courseware (OCW) initiatives, which provide free and open access to the
   knowledge produced by the universities for any individual learner
   worldwide.
   This paper presents the main activities carried out in a teaching
   innovation project financed by the University of Zaragoza (UZ, Spain)
   within the OER Programme. This project is a continuation and an
   extension of the work carried out in the last two years, in which a set
   of educational videos has been developed, as modular and reusable
   learning objects. During this time, the authors have detected a clear
   improvement in the teaching-learning process in a total of seven
   subjects in the field of Thermal Engineering, taught in five different
   degree courses. Although, to date, these educational videos have been
   made only available to enrolled students in the internal Moodle platform
   of the UZ, from this year the complete set of videos is published within
   the OCW platform of the UZ.
   The OCW has been designed as a compilation of audio-visual material to
   support teaching in subjects in the field of Thermodynamics and Thermal
   Engineering. Thus, the materials included in the OCW are mainly
   educational videos with theoretical explanations and some practical
   training exercises. All the videos have a homogeneous format and
   duration, and are licensed under a Creative Commons license. Each video
   is accompanied by a brief description, which includes the title, author,
   license for use, summary and contents index, as well as a list of
   subjects in which the video can be used as complementary teaching
   material. In addition, after each video, a short self-assessment
   questionnaire is proposed to learners to check their assimilation and
   understanding degree of the contents explained.
   Finally, the paper presents the students feedback on the usefulness of
   the above mentioned materials to support the learning process in a
   subject taught this academic year. The results so far show that these
   materials have helped to improve students' understanding of the most
   abstract and complex concepts, while at the same time contributing to
   increase their level of motivation.},

Abstract = {We study unsupervised video representation learning that seeks to learn
   both motion and appearance features from unlabeled video only, which can
   be reused for downstream tasks such as action recognition. This task,
   however, is extremely challenging due to 1) the highly complex
   spatial-temporal information in videos and 2) the lack of labeled data
   for training Unlike representation learning for static images, it is
   difficult to construct a suitable self-supervised task to effectively
   model both motion and appearance features. More recently, several
   attempts have been made to learn video representation through video
   playback speed prediction. However, it is non-trivial to obtain precise
   speed labels for the videos. More critically, the learned models may
   tend to focus on motion patterns and thus may not learn appearance
   features well. In this paper, we observe that the relative playback
   speed is more consistent with motion patterns and thus provides more
   effective and stable supervision for representation learning. Therefore,
   we propose a new way to perceive the playback speed and exploit the
   relative speed between two video clips as labels. In this way, we are
   able to effectively perceive speed and learn better motion features.
   Moreover, to ensure the learning of appearance features, we further
   propose an appearance-focused task, where we enforce the model to
   perceive the appearance difference between two video clips. We show that
   jointly optimizing the two tasks consistently improves the performance
   on two downstream tasks (namely, action recognition and video retrieval)
   w.r.t the increasing pre-training epochs. Remarkably, for action
   recognition on the UCF101 dataset, we achieve 93.7\% accuracy without
   the use of labeled data for pre-training, which outperforms the ImageNet
   supervised pre-trained model. Our code, pre-trained models, and
   supplementary materials can be found at

Title = {Promoting teachers' in-class SRL practices: effects of Authentic

Abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is essential for independent active
   learners. Despite its importance, supporting students' SRL is often
   challenging for teachers who lack the necessary knowledge and skills for
   in-class SRL practices. Hence, there is a need to support teachers' SRL:
   both as learners-how to self-regulate their own learning, and as
   teachers-how to use practices to support students' SRL. This study
   proposes an innovative instructional model empowered by ``Authentic
   Interactive Dynamic Experiences{''} ({''}AIDE{''}) oriented to SRL and
   called the SRL-AIDE model. To examine the effectiveness of the model, we
   designed a professional development program based on the SRL-AIDE model,
   called the SRL-AIDE program. It involved explicit exposure to SRL
   theory, beliefs in independent learning as enhancing SRL, and immersive
   experiences including video-based learning and simulations with live
   actors to stimulate motivation for SRL classroom implementation. The
   model's effectiveness was evaluated using authentic methods. Seventy-six
   teachers participated in either the SRL-AIDE program (experimental
   group) or a control program focused on effective learning principles.
   The results indicated a shift in beliefs toward independent learning as
   a core behavior in enhancing SRL, and a highly significant and
   systematic increase among the experimental group in the lesson plan,
   performance, and reflection (on the performed lesson) as phases in the
   teaching relating to the SRL cycle, including cognitive, metacognitive,
   and independent learning strategies. The improvements of the SRL
   practices were apparent in two measurement types: explicitness level and
   duration. Implications for class instruction, teachers' professional
   development oriented toward students' outcomes, and authentic evaluation
   are discussed.},

Abstract = {One of the main aims of English education at junior high school is to
   develop Students' practical communication skills such as listening and
   speaking. However, it is difficult for one teacher to instruct each
   student individually in class. With this consideration in mind, we
   developed WBT courseware for English listening, incorporating a high
   quantity of video and sound clips for self-practice. Through utilizing
   it as a part of `Blended Learning' with pair or group activities in
   class, we have studied the effectiveness of the instruction with WBT.
   The result of the research shows that students' desire for
   self-expression in English was raised and their listening ability for
   comprehending the situation was also improved.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {This study focused on open online character education implemented in
   e-HO, a holistic learning environment embedded with a character exemplar
   video-on-demand (VOD) system. E-HO, designed to use the Internet to
   enhance holistic and character education's efficacies in a way that is
   fitting for and favored by digital natives, also aimed to counteract the
   negative impacts of the mass media. A comprehensive investigation of a
   survey conducted among 1013 university students for this e-character
   education program is presented with a detailed study on students'
   preferences referring to various demographic variables including grade
   level, gender, discipline and the number of exemplar exposure instances
   concerning the five scales extracted in this particular survey. In
   accordance with previous studies, this study suggested that grade level
   differences could be explained by cognitive ability. Gender differences
   and discipline differences both emerged because of differences in
   ``people-things{''} orientation between genders and also between
   disciplines with distinct, long-term professional foci and practices.
   Compelling counterbalancing effects were witnessed between the
   developments of discipline differences and grade level differences,
   which were greatly enhanced by consistently implementing holistic
   education. A preliminary ``cognitive threshold{''} of VOD exposure
   within a semester among the female participants appeared at 10 viewings,
   beyond which substantially more effective pedagogical efficacies
   emerged. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In minimally invasive surgery videos, label-free monocular laparoscopic
   depth estimation is challenging due to smoke. For this reason, we
   propose a self-supervised collaborative network-based depth estimation
   method with smoke-removal for monocular endoscopic video, which is
   decomposed into two steps of smoke-removal and depth estimation. In the
   first step, we develop a de-endoscopic smoke for cyclic GAN (DS-cGAN) to
   mitigate the smoke components at different concentrations. The designed
   generator network comprises sharpened guide encoding module (SGEM),
   residual dense bottleneck module (RDBM) and refined upsampling
   convolution module (RUCM), which restores more detailed organ edges and
   tissue structures. In the second step, high resolution residual U-Net
   (HRR-UNet) consisting of a DepthNet and two PoseNets is designed to
   improve the depth estimation accuracy, and adjacent frames are used for
   camera self-motion estimation. In particular, the proposed method
   requires neither manual labeling nor patient computed tomography scans
   during the training and inference phases. Experimental studies on the
   laparoscopic data set of the Hamlyn Centre show that our method can
   effectively achieve accurate depth information after net smoking in real
   surgical scenes while preserving the blood vessels, contours and
   textures of the surgical site. The experimental results demonstrate that
   the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in
   effectiveness and achieves a frame rate of 94.45fps in real time, making
   it a promising clinical application.},

Abstract = {With the continuous improvement and development of cameras network,
   surveillance video has become the data source of the column stream,
   which greatly promotes the development of cross-camera person
   re-identification (Re-ID). However, supervised learning requires a lot
   of effort to manually label cross-cameras pairwise training data, which
   is lack of scalability and practical in actual video surveillance
   because there is a lack of well-labeled pairs of positive and negative
   samples under each camera. For addressing these negative effects, we set
   judgment conditions by using the association ranking method to
   self-discover positive and negative track-lets pairs of anchors with
   none of the pairwise ID labels, thereby defining a triplet loss. In
   order to optimize association loss for learning effective discriminative
   feature, the triplet loss adds adaptive weights according to the degree
   of easy-hard samples to generate an Adaptive Weighted Conditional
   Triplet Loss. Besides, for increasing the accuracy of self-discovering
   cross-camera anchors independently, which means successfully mine
   mutually best-matched track-lets and merge them under cross-camera, we
   use the top-rank from the intra-camera ranking list as a self-matched
   query sample which can double verify the matched-degree between
   top-rank. And eventually, we establish a new Association Loss and
   Self-Discovery Learning (ALSL) model with a complete end-to-end manner.
   We use three standard datasets, PRID2011, iLIDS-VID and MARS, to train
   the model and the experimental results prove that ALSL rank-1 is better
   than some superior video-based unsupervised person Re-ID methods.},

Abstract = {There are numerous texts and articles that have theorized game design,
   providing ``how to{''} guides and whole manuals for carrying out game
   design projects, as well as many texts on how to use games to teach
   other. There is, however, a paucity of research and guidance on critical
   approaches to video games for students - how to research them, and what
   their study could and already does entail. This lack of discussions of
   critical methodologies both in courses available in game design
   programs, as well as in published scholarly work, is not present to the
   same degree in adjacent cultural studies education programs, such as
   those focused on film, art, design, drama, or digital media. This
   project, informed by participatory action research, asked 15
   undergraduate researchers in a Canadian university from a variety of
   disciplines (physics; computer science; arts; gender, sexuality and
   women's studies; film, and chemistry) to design and pursue a novel video
   game focused research study, supported by a professor and 3 research
   assistants (2 Master's and 1 PhD-level). All of the undergraduates were
   self-selected gender and racialized minorities, some of whom played
   games regularly and a few who did not and were curious to learn more.
   Over ten months from September 2019 to June 2020, impacted by the global
   COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented a curriculum to train
   and help support participants in how to construct their own research
   projects to study video games from a comparative media analysis
   perspective. This paper will report on how we approached the study of
   games and describe the curriculum framework for studying games we
   developed. We will report on what worked, what did not work, and our
   suggestions for future related projects.},

Title = {The effect of video presentation in a CBT environment},
Journal = {EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY \& SOCIETY},
Year = {2006},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Pages = {123-138},
Abstract = {Multimedia is increasingly used to enhance human-computer interaction in
   a variety of formats (text, graphics, audio, animation, and video). The
   challenge is how to use the most effective presentation format that
   would result in performance improvement. This paper addresses the added
   value of video presentations in a technology-mediated learning
   environment for a basic Management Information System course at MBA
   level. We postulate two hypotheses that take into account students'
   mastery learning and satisfaction with regard to the usefulness of video
   presentation, moderated by students' self-interest to learn the subject
   matter (i.e., intrinsic motivation). Our analysis, on the basis of
   empirical research, shows that the subjects find a learning environment
   supported with video presentations is more useful. Their intrinsic

   experienced two VM interventions, across 10 sessions, during an
   alternating treatments design: VM using a teacher model, and feedforward
   video self-modelling (FFVSM) where the student acted as the model. For
   two participants, FFVSM was found to be an effective intervention but
   overall, results for both interventions were inconsistent with previous
   research. Talking Mats Interviews were used to include these individuals
   within the social validation process of behavioural research.},

Abstract = {The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of flipped learning
   method on students' perception and learning of Java programming where
   the content of the course is delivered in two ways with two groups of
   students, one experimental group and one control group. The experimental
   group was taught with flipped learning method where all materials were
   developed by the researcher in a form of pre-recorded video lectures
   delivered to the students and in-class group activities supervised by
   the instructor. The control group had traditional weekly lectures and
   exercises at home. This study was conducted for 10 weeks with 174
   students in total and employed an explanatory mixed method research
   design with qualitative and quantitative approaches. The data collected
   through the achievement test, Course Evaluation (CEQ), and Students'
   Perceptions/Opinions of Flipped Learning in Engineering Education
   Questionnaire (SOFLEEQ) were analyzed by using descriptive and
   inferential statistical analysis techniques. For data analysis, SPSS
   24.0 was used and alpha level was determined as .05. Significant
   differences were found between the experimental and control group in
   terms of students' achievements and positive reactions towards flipped
   learning methodology. In the experimental group, students' learning
   attitudes, motivation and self-evaluation were enhanced. The findings
   show that flipped classroom outperforms traditional classroom and
   students' perception toward flipped learning became more positive.},

Year = {2011},
Volume = {23},

Pages = {252-270},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Several authors (e. g., Mcniff \& Whitehead, 2006; Wallace, 1998) defend
   the idea that teachers' own involvement in research has the potential to
   encourage professional growth. Journal writing, teacher logs, written
   narratives and stimulated recall are some examples of methods that have
   been used by researchers to encourage and support teachers' reflective
   practice in teacher-researcher collaborative research. This paper
   discusses the use of video-stimulated reflection as both a research
   method and as a means for teacher professional growth. The research
   findings are drawn from a longitudinal study that investigates a model
   of Interactive Whiteboard (IWB) technology professional development
   programme. The research was carried out in the form of seven in-depth
   case studies with English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teachers in German
   secondary/vocational schools, as they learn how to integrate the IWB
   into their teaching. Research data were collected via a variety of
   research instruments, namely classroom observations and field notes,
   video recordings of school lessons and teacher training workshops,
   interviews and video-stimulated reflection. Findings based on the
   analysis of the copious amount of data gathered indicate that the
   video-stimulated dialogues were used by the teachers as effective
   opportunities for reflection, self-evaluation and pedagogical
   development.},

Volume = {55},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Based on a review of recent key articles, this paper demonstrates that
   many elements of physician-patient communication can be learned
   successfully during medical education. Methods of assessment and
   definition of success depend largely on the definition of teaching
   goals, which are usually based on the principles of a more egalitarian
   and non-paternalistic physician-patient communication. In this article
   another approach is suggested. Teaching objectives in patient-physician
   communication can also be deduced from the needs of clinical medicine,
   resulting in the following goals: students are able to gather relevant
   data from patients' history, they explicitly structure the consultation
   and the way they give information, they know how to respond to patients'
   emotions. The Objective Standardised Clinical Examination (OSCE) is
   discussed with its strengths and weaknesses. The inclusion of
   video-based feedback is presented as a teaching tool to improve
   students' self-reflection. Workplace-based assessment and Mini-CEX are
   promising educational tools that require a well-trained faculty, not
   only in the teaching and practice of communication but also in the art
   of giving constructive and yet honest feedback.},

Abstract = {Research in music education asserts that video review by performers
   facilitates self-directed learning and transforms performing. Yet,
   certain videos may be traumatic for musicians to view; those who
   perceive themselves as failing or experience performance-related
   failures are prone to feelings of distress and sadness that can
   negatively affect their music-making and well-being. In this study, the
   reactions of nine Canadian undergraduate pianists to reviewing
   themselves regularly on video are examined. The study was designed in
   two parts: first of all, to track the effects of watching self-referent
   videos of piano lessons and other performances; second, to highlight
   student responses to a Recital Review Protocol (RRP). The RRP was
   designed with instructors and students in mind, incorporating
   neuroscience strategies to reverse blood flow patterns in areas of the
   brain responsible for negative mood induction. The results from the
   first part of the study point to how regular video analysis is able to
   shift initial negative perceptions and transform practicing and
   performing. The findings from the second part indicate that more
   attention needs to be paid to students by instructors immediately after
   performances.},

Title = {Accessing online learning material: Quantitative behavior patterns and
   their effects on motivation and learning performance},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {114},
Pages = {286-297},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Accessing learning materials, that is, lecture slides, video lectures,
   shared assignments, and forum messages, is the most frequently performed
   online learning activity. However, students with different purposes,
   motivations, and preferences may exhibit different behaviors when
   accessing these materials. These different behaviors may further affect
   their learning performance. This study analyzed system logs recorded by
   a Learning Management System in which 59 computer science students
   participated in a blended learning course to learn mobile phone
   programming. The results revealed several significant findings. First,
   the students viewed the learning materials related to their classroom
   lectures (i.e., lecture slides and video lectures) for longer and more
   often than other learning materials (i.e., shared assignments and posted
   messages). Second, although the students spent a great deal of time
   viewing the online learning materials, most did not use annotation
   tools. Third, students' viewing behaviors showed great variety and were
   clustered into three behavior patterns: ``consistent use students{''}
   who intensively used all of the learning materials, ``slide intensive
   use students{''} who intensively used the lecture slides, and ``less use
   students{''} who infrequently used any learning material. These
   different behavior patterns were also associated with their motivation
   and learning performance. The results are discussed, and several
   suggestions for teachers, researchers, and system designers are
   proposed. (C) 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

   movement and posture, causing activity limitation. This means that
   people affected by this disease are unable to handle the usual devices
   used in video games. Moreover, video games offer these people a form of
   leisure that can also benefit them in many ways: autonomy, strength,
   coordination, self-confidence, learning from error, etc. Three adapted
   video games have been developed as well as a guide for designing
   accessible video games for people with cerebral palsy. This experience
   has served to study and design new ways of making video games accessible
   to disabled people, giving them the chance to exercise their right to
   entertainment.},

Abstract = {This Innovative Practice Work-In-Progress article describes the
   implementation of video material in undergraduate mathematics and
   physics courses for engineering and computer science students. The
   COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to provide online material to
   which students can return whenever their technical and temporal
   resources allow. A similar need has long existed among students who
   support themselves by working part- or even full-time while studying
   towards a degree. This student group is well represented at our
   institution as access and outreach initiatives target professionals with
   vocational training in a technical field. The didactic concept of the
   videos as well as didactic opportunities for face-to-face lecturing in
   combination with online video material will be described. Students'
   responses to the innovative practice were surveyed in two ways: first,
   through an online questionnaire administered to students of an
   introductory physics course. The questionnaire data is subjected to
   quantitative and qualitative analysis in this article, with results
   leading to an indication of high student satisfaction. Second, students'
   experience as gathered from group interviews with students from a
   first-year mathematics course will be analysed. Collectively, this
   information sheds light on the advantages of the practice presented as
   well as on further improvements.},

Abstract = {Fundamental movement skills acquired during pre-school years provide the
   basis of normal motor development, positive self-image, self-perceived
   sports competencies in the adolescence. An instructional approach
   supported with visual materials may improve learning in pre-school
   children. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of
   digital physical exercise videos on pre-school children's locomotor
   skill learning. A total of 906 children (662 Turkish and 244 Bulgarian),
   participated in the study as intervention (n = 442) and control (n =
   464) groups. Each motor skill program consisted of video based 15-minute
   physical exercise for eight-weeks. Ulrich's Test of Gross Motor
   Development was used for the assessment of fundamental motor skill
   performance at the beginning of the study as pre-test and at the end of
   the eight-week digital visual supported locomotor movement program as
   posttest. Two separate 2 x 2 (Group x Time) ANOVAs with repeated
   measures were used to analyze the improvement in locomotor skills
   performances of intervention and control groups. Results indicated
   significant Group x Time interactions for the locomotor sub-scale (p <
   0.05). The intervention group showed a statistically significant
   improvement in locomotor skills, whereas control group did not show any
   significant change. The result provide evidence that locomotor motor
   skill performance may be improved via digital materials focused on
   locomotor skill development.},

   traditional way of teaching, as the control group. While the second
   year's study, deploying a teaching model of BL with SRL, functions as
   the treatment group. The results showed that students in the group of BL
   with SRL had significantly higher pass rate of certification than those
   in the control group, and had a positive attitude toward the teaching

Abstract = {Recently, computer technology and multimedia elements have been
   developed and integrated into teaching and learning. Entertainment-based
   learning environments can make learning contents more attractive, and
   thus can lead to learners' active participation and facilitate learning.
   A significant amount of research examines using video editing software
   to create video clips for digital storytelling activities. However, in
   this study, we suggest performing digital storytelling in virtual worlds
   with open-ended, edutainment elements, and place more stress on the
   writing process. The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of
   writing for digital storytelling on writing self-efficacy and on flow in
   the virtual reality learning environment known as Second Life. The
   researchers organized an activity for undergraduate students to create
   digital stories. Participants were divided into two groups. One group
   created their digital stories in Second Life. The other group created
   their digital stories off-line. The two groups' independent sample
   t-tests were employed to compare writing self-efficacy and flow. The
   results of the experiment demonstrate that digital storytelling in a
   virtual learning environment is more effective than digital storytelling
   off-line. The findings of this study suggest that the technique of
   digital storytelling can be used effectively in classroom settings to
   teach writing.},

Title = {Cross-domain few-shot action recognition with unlabeled videos},
Journal = {COMPUTER VISION AND IMAGE UNDERSTANDING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {233},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Current few-shot action recognition approaches have achieved impressive
   performance using only a few labeled examples. However, they usually
   assume the base (train) and target (test) videos typically come from the
   same domain, which may limit their further applications. In this paper,
   we introduce a new practical task, termed as cross-domain few-shot
   action recognition, and hypothesize there is a domain shift between the
   base and target videos and the unlabeled target videos are available. To
   address this task, we further propose a Self-supervised learning
   Enhanced tEmporal Network (SEEN), which incorporates temporal modeling
   and self -supervised learning techniques to learn more transferable
   representations. Concretely, the temporal modeling mechanism aims to
   learn long-range temporal semantics from the features output by the
   backbone, and the self-supervised learning focuses on exploring the
   underlying data patterns to reduce domain shifts under the few-shot
   setting, which can help to improve the generalization ability.
   Therefore, the proposed SEEN can capture broader variations of the
   feature distributions and is more appropriate for the cross-domain
   few-shot action recognition task. Extensive experiments on multiple
   cross-domain benchmarks show that our SEEN consistently outperforms
   several strong baseline methods by a convincing margin.},

Abstract = {To improve the relevance of course activities to address adult learner
   needs, the author has developed an online digital repository of
   authentic learning artifacts in his undergraduate online course
   (exploration of western classical music) as the first stage of an action
   research project for which user experience data collection will be
   performed. Authentic learning in this context is based on the author's
   initial curriculum innovation in which traditional assessments (quizzes,
   essay assignments, etc.) of recall of facts and concepts about music
   composers and compositions are augmented by a series of online music
   resources (music scores, audio/video performances) that form the basis
   of discussion and project assignments in which learning is situated in
   the authentic practice domain of music (composition and performance).
   The author describes his theoretical framework based on a review of
   research literature into situated and social learning theories and his
   research into learning style preferences of online learners as the basis
   for supporting online learners with online presentation of relevant
   audio and video materials. This framework is followed by an account of
   the rationale and techniques that were used to search and select audio
   and video material from online data repositories that conform to
   established conventions for public domain, licensed, and fair use of
   intellectual property. A description follows of how these research
   findings have guided the instructional design of learning activities and
   associated forms of (self, peer, and instructor) assessment. The author
   describes the initial implementation and informal evaluation of this
   innovation during the first course section. The paper concludes with a
   proposal for subsequent user experience evaluation that is deemed
   appropriate to the early adoption stage of this e-learning innovation.},

Abstract = {The aim of this research is to introduce the ideal lecture technique to
   the literature by explaining the anatomy of the skeletal system using
   the classical method, video-assisted method and 3D imaging techniques.
   The research was carried out with 180 students. The number of samples
   was determined by power analysis (a=0.05,b=0.20, effect size=0.25).
   Participants were pre-screened and divided into 4 groups with the
   closest group mean (group 1: control group: the group that did not take
   anatomy lessons, group 2: video-assisted anatomy education, group 3: 3D
   anatomy course, group 4: classical anatomy education group). The courses
   in the training groups were organised as 4 hours/day, 2 days/week for 5
   weeks. At the end of the course, the students were re-examined and
   scaled to determine the difference in scores and self-efficacy between
   the groups. A one-way ANOVA test was performed because the data were
   normally distributed when comparing between groups. The mean scores were
   calculated as group 1=30.22 \& PLUSMN;6.24, group 2=39.02 \&
   PLUSMN;9.15, group 3=49.77 \& PLUSMN;9.20 and group 4=59.28 \&
   PLUSMN;8.95. In the post hoc comparison, in pairwise comparisons between
   all groups, the differences were highly significant (p<0.001). According
   to the results of the self-efficacy scale, the groups were ranked as
   group 4>group 3>group 2>group 1 (p<0.001). According to the results of
   this study, the laboratory method in skeletal anatomy teaching is the
   best alternative to 3D anatomy teaching.},

Abstract = {An online video library comprising three different types of videos was
   used intensively by bachelor-level students before and throughout an
   introductory organic chemistry laboratory course, when presented and
   assigned to the experiments appropriately. An empirical study (N = 103)
   revealed that the utilization of videos and preferences for video types
   depend crucially on individual student characteristics, such as gender,
   study course, intrinsic motivation, and the self-perception of
   conscientiousness. Student assessment of the video library, a positive
   impact on students' self-concept of ability, and an increase of
   knowledge in know-how tests on laboratory techniques of up to 100\%
   indicate the benefits of the online video library on students'
   cognitive, affective, and psychomotor learning in a laboratory course.},

Abstract = {Students in advanced undergraduate chemistry laboratories are required
   to undertake a wide range of complex and multistep syntheses and
   analytical procedures, and prospective employers of chemistry graduates
   seek students with proven skills in these areas. Our approach has been
   to use video resources which are made available to students both ahead
   of, and during, their laboratory classes to assist with preparation and
   provide just-in-time self-help during the laboratory. In this study we
   evaluate the implementation of a user-focused strategy to improve
   students' laboratory skills and use a threestage model, forethought,
   performance, and self-reflection, to assess the impact and effectiveness
   of these resources to complement the traditional laboratory teaching
   resources of laboratory manuals and laboratory teaching staff
   (demonstrators). Students demonstrated autonomous learning by engaging
   with the laboratory videos using both active and passive learning
   approaches. The benefits of our approach are especially evident for
   students who have English as a second language and students who identify
   with different learning preferences. Increased student grades and more
   effective staffstudent supervision time requirements are evident across
   both third-year undergraduate chemistry courses in which these videos
   were implemented.},

Abstract = {Sustainable design and engineering is an important topic, yet it is
   under-represented in educational institutions; moreover, it must be
   taught to practicing professionals, not just students. A free online
   system has been created to address both problems at once, providing
   educational materials for educators and also providing a self-paced
   program for professionals or students to earn a certificate in
   sustainable design. Called the Autodesk Sustainability Workshop, it is a
   collection of video tutorials and supporting materials (PDF reference
   guides, slide decks, quizzes, and other resources) that can be used
   either by individuals themselves or by educators (either in schools or
   the workplace) to learn principles and practical skills related to green
   design, mechanical engineering, and building science. Its dozens of
   video tutorials span the range from introduction to fundamental
   principles in sustainability, to specific operation of analytical
   software tools such as PEA and energy modeling. All videos are on
   focused topics and of short duration (typically 3 - 6 minutes) so they
   can be inserted into curricula as educators see fit, not forcing a full
   curriculum structure. For self-guided learners, or educators who desire
   a full curriculum, an interactive structure provides quizzes along with
   the learning resources; upon successful completion, they lead up to a
   certificate in green design. Currently there is only one certificate, in
   basic building science; future releases will expand the certificate
   program to sustainable product design as well, since many of the
   learning resources are on these topics. For content not covered by the
   certificate program, the website's information architecture suggests a
   multi-threaded approach to learning sustainable design. As
   three-quarters of a million people around the world have already viewed
   content from the site, this self-directed online learning system is
   proposed to be a highly scalable method of providing sustainable design
   and engineering education.},

Abstract = {Flipped classroom is a new blended type of pedagogy. This study attempts
   to examine whether flipped classroom, with reference to self-regulation
   principles, is a good pedagogy for enhancing formative learning outcomes
   for first year university students. A total of 73 students, enrolled on
   a teacher education program, participated in this study. Data were
   collected from different sources in three phases. In the first phase,
   data were collected from pre- and post-tests, and the number of viewings
   of the assigned online videos were logged. Techniques in editing images
   applied by the group and the individual were examined in the second
   phase. Finally, opinions related to flipped classroom were collected
   from focus group interviews in the third phase. The results suggest that
   students are able to apply their self-learned knowledge to editing
   images both together and individually. They were very positive about
   flipped classroom activities and all 7 self-regulated (SR) learning
   principles were achieved. While students embraced the flexibility of
   learning online, they missed the face-to-face interaction with the
   teacher and their learning peers. This was especially the case when they
   did not understand the content of the online videos. This study provides
   an additional lens of SR principles.},

Abstract = {This study explores the effectiveness of the sequential use of lectures
   and video podcasting in higher education. Drawing together several
   theories, this paper examines the influence of student's perceived prior
   knowledge gained from lectures and technology acceptance model-related
   variables on student's self-reported assimilation of new material
   presented through podcasting. Data were obtained from 179 undergraduates
   and were analyzed using a structural equation modelling approach. The
   results showed the influence of prior knowledge gained from lectures and
   effective use of video podcasts on perceived assimilation of additional
   knowledge. It was also found that perceived ease of use and perceived
   usefulness determine the attitude towards using video podcasts, which in
   turn positively affects the effective use of this tool. The findings
   suggest that lectures are very valuable to develop learning processes
   based on the podcasting technology and also that encouraging the
   acceptance and effective use of video podcasting is important in the
   learning experience.},

   Making use of alternative teaching approaches is crucial to allow a

   This paper describes the model, implementation and preliminary

   Students may attend the courses either in the classroom, Face-to-Face
   mode (FFM), or remotely, in Distance Mode (DM), through a video/audio
   conference system. Classes are recorded and made permanently available
   to every student through a Learning Management System.
   We have developed an assessment quiz to evaluate the impact of this
   learning model presented before and after the instruction period.
   It was observed an increase in grades, when comparing the initial and
   final assessment quizzes grades. No significant differences were found
   between FFM and DM groups regarding final course grades.
   Results suggest that there is a learning progress, that the learning
   model is robust and was mimicked over to the DM group seamlessly.},

Volume = {20},

Abstract = {Flipped learning is a well-recognized learning mode that reverses the
   traditional in-class instruction arrangement by delivering learning
   content outside of the classroom and engaging students in more
   activities in class. However, it remains a challenge for students to
   comprehend the learning material by themselves, particularly when
   learning abstract concepts such as in mathematics. In this study, an
   interactive e-book approach is proposed to support flipped learning. It
   facilitates and bridges out-of-class and in-class learning by providing
   support for interactive learning contents presented on mobile devices.
   To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, a
   quasi-experiment was conducted in an elementary school math course. The
   experimental group students learned with the interactive e-book approach
   in the flipped learning activity, while the control group students
   learned with the conventional video-based flipped learning approach. The
   experimental results indicated that the proposed approach not only
   promoted the students' self-efficacy for learning mathematics, but also
   improved their learning achievement; moreover, it was found that the
   approach benefited the lower self-efficacy more than the higher
   self-efficacy students. The learning record analysis further confirmed
   that the lower self-efficacy students spent more time reading the
   e-books before and in class than the higher self-efficacy students did.},

Abstract = {The lecture has been a core pedagogical method since the early days of
   formal medical education. Although approaches to formal lectures have
   evolved over the years, there has been ongoing debate about the role
   that lectures should play in modern medical education. Arguably,
   traditional lectures do not align well with modern learning theory, and
   do not take full advantage of our current knowledge of how people learn.
   In many modern medical curricula, lectures have been replaced by
   self-study activities, including video-based lectures, computer-based
   learning modules, and other self-directed learning. We argue that
   scheduled together time is still important, particularly in neurology
   education, where there is a strong emphasis on clinical reasoning. We
   outline alternative teaching methods that effectively use this time,
   including the flipped classroom, just-in-time teaching, problem-based
   learning, and team-based learning. We discuss ways in which these
   approaches may be particularly conducive to components of neurology
   education.},

Title = {Impacts of classroom teaching practices on students' mathematics

Abstract = {Teaching effectiveness is a core issue in educational research; however,
   there is little consensus about the most important results of classroom
   teaching from an international perspective. The effectiveness of
   teaching has remained a `black box' for a long time. In the secondary
   study described in this paper we used empirical data for Shanghai taken
   from the international Organization for Economic Co-operation and
   Development (OECD) study Global Teaching InSights (GTI)-initially the
   Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS) Video Study-which was
   based on videotaped direct observations of classroom teaching.
   Eighty-five junior high school mathematics teachers and their students
   in Shanghai were observed to explore the impact of specific teaching
   practices on students' interest, self-efficacy, and mathematics
   achievement scores. The results revealed that social-emotional support
   and instruction quality were the key dimensions relating to the
   characteristics and differences of mathematics lessons in Shanghai.
   While the former had a significantly positive impact on students'
   general mathematics self-efficacy, the latter had a significantly
   positive impact on students' mathematics interest. Although specific
   teaching practices had no significant direct impact on students'
   mathematics achievement scores, social-emotional support and instruction
   quality considerably influenced students' academic performance in an
   indirect way via general self-efficacy.},

Title = {An effective intervention using STEM instruction for improving
   preservice science teachers' self-efficacy},
Journal = {RESEARCH IN SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 MAY 10},
Abstract = {BackgroundScience teacher education programs are considered to play a
   critical role in preparing future science teachers who are more
   innovative and capable of effectively implementing integrated STEM
   education.PurposeThis research investigates the effectiveness of a
   professional development program enriched by the skills-based science,
   technology, engineering, and mathematics model (SB-STEM-M) on preservice
   science teachers' self-efficacy.SampleThe participants of this study are
   twenty preservice teachers in a state university science education
   program.Design and MethodsThis research was carried out over 14 weeks
   using mixed-methods research, with the implementation process consisting
   of three stages, with the last stage involving the preservice teachers'
   preparation of SB-STEM activity sets alongside evaluations, and
   feedback. The quantitative data in the research were obtained using the
   Self-Efficacy and Concerns about STEM Education Instrument, which was
   used as a pre-and post-test. The qualitative data were obtained through
   the activity sets and videos the preservice teachers prepared based on
   SB-STEM-M as well as through interview forms and focus group
   interviews.ResultsThe results from the quantitative and qualitative data
   analyses show the preservice teachers' STEM self-efficacy to have
   improved using the professional development program enriched with
   SB-STEM-M, while no change had occurred regarding their STEM concerns
   like information and evaluation, management, consequence and
   refocusing.ConclusionThe three-stage intervention process applied to the
   preservice teachers enabled them to both develop original STEM activity
   sets in accordance with SB-STEM-M as well as to increase their STEM
   self-efficacy. The activity sets and videos the preservice teachers
   prepared reveal evidence that they had achieved the capacity to have
   their classrooms apply the activity sets in their future professional
   life. The data obtained through the interview forms and focus group
   interviews reveal them to have learned to integrate scientific process
   and reasoning skills into STEM disciplines.},

Title = {Does an instructor's facial expressions override their body gestures in
   video lectures?},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {193},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {While teaching, instructors will use unplanned, spontaneous facial
   expressions and body gestures to express their emotions. There is a
   growing consensus that an instructor's emotional expressions can trigger
   students' emotional and psychological responses, thus enhancing or
   inhibiting their learning in both face-to-face and online teaching
   contexts. However, little systematic research exists on which specific
   design features of an instructor's movements can induce emotions in
   video lectures. Three experiments were conducted in this study.
   Experiment 1 aimed to test the congruency/incongruency effects of an
   instructor's facial expressions (happy vs. bored) and body gestures
   (happy vs. bored) on student learning from video lectures in terms of
   students' emotions, motivation, cognitive load, and learning
   performance. Results of Experiment 1 showed that the instructor's happy
   facial expressions induced more positive emotions, enhanced motivation,
   and improved learning performance in students than the bored facial
   expressions, regardless of the instructor's body gestures. Experiment 2
   sought to build upon the unexpected finding from Experiment 1 by
   increasing the frequency of body gestures, seeking evidence from both
   self -reports and eye movements. Results of Experiment 2 showed that the
   instructor's happy facial expressions enhanced students' learning
   performance when the instructor did not use body gestures, but not when
   they used increased body gestures. Experiment 3 was conducted to further
   expand upon findings from Experiment 1 and Experiment 2. Results of
   Experiment 3 confirmed the emotion-motivational and cognitive benefits
   of the instructor's happy facial expressions. The results have
   implications for designing features of instructors in video lectures: if
   instructors are visible, they should be encouraged to exhibit happy
   facial expressions, using body gestures less frequently or even avoid
   body gestures entirely.},

Abstract = {This tutorial will introduce our Accessibility Learning Labs (ALL). The
   objectives of this collaborative project with The National Technical
   Institute for the Deaf (NTID) are to both inform participants about
   foundational topics in accessibility and to demonstrate the importance
   of creating accessible software. The labs enable easy classroom
   inclusion by providing instructors all necessary materials including
   lecture and activity slides and videos. Each lab addresses an
   accessibility issue and contains: I) Relevant background information on
   the examined issue II) An example web-based application containing the
   accessibility problem III) A process to emulate this accessibility
   problem IV) Details about how to repair the problem from a technical
   perspective V) Incidents from people who encountered this accessibility
   issue and how it has impacted their life.
   The labs may be easily integrated into a wide variety of curriculum at
   high schools (9-12), and in undergraduate and graduate courses. The labs
   will be easily adoptable due to their self-contained nature and their
   inclusion of all necessary instructional material (e.g., slides,
   quizzes, etc.). No special software is required to use any portion of
   the labs since they are web-based and are able to run on any computer
   with a reasonably recent web browser. There are currently four available
   labs on the topics of: Colorblindness, Hearing, Blindness and Dexterity.
   Material is available on our website: http://all.rit.edu
   This tutorial will provide an overview of the created labs and usage
   instructions and information for adaptors.},

Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Teachers need to notice and interpret student behavior as part of their
   everyday classroom work. Current teacher education programs often do not
   explicitly focus on helping pre-service teachers learn to analyze and
   interpret student behavior and understand how it may influence teachers'
   teaching behaviors, which in turn may affect students' thinking and
   achievements. Using a quasi-experimental design, the current study
   examined a systematic reflective approach promoting dual learning from
   both teacher and student perspectives in authentic videotaped
   classrooms. More specifically, the study examined how this dual
   reflective ``professional vision{''} framework influenced pre-service
   teachers' actual ability to explicitly teach meta-strategic knowledge
   (MSK) to students. Results indicated that pre-service teachers whose
   video-analysis reflected on both teachers' and students' behaviors
   demonstrated greater improvement in their MSK-teaching, and their
   students showed better MSK achievements, compared to pre-service
   teachers whose video-analysis reflected only on teachers' behaviors. The
   current study suggests the need to integrate systematic dual reflective
   professional vision approaches - that analyze not only teachers' but
   also students' behaviors - into teacher preparation programs as a means
   for developing pre-service teachers' capacity to promote students' MSK.},

Abstract = {There is so-called troublesome knowledge in every subject. There is
   various subject-specific research available on what these particular
   concepts are, as well as some examples of how to help students cross
   those thresholds. There is, however, a gap in the area of
   implementation, a more practical format for addressing student learning
   when there are threshold concepts. As active learning encourages deep
   learning, this is key to any pedagogical method used. There is a need
   for a mix of teaching approaches to address the diverse learning styles
   that exist in any class. This paper seeks to provide a viable format
   that can be applied to any subject. This format is based on a flipped
   lesson in physics (in a higher education context) and the results from
   three cohorts across two academic years. The paper highlights the need
   for meta-learning when dealing with threshold concepts, as well as the
   use of interactive videos as a practical tool that contributes to
   self-efficacy.},

   teach business principles and business operations. This study, which was
   conducted at three universities, describes the perspectives and
   sustainability virtues of pre-service business education teachers who
   attended a workshop aimed at integrating sustainability in their teacher
   training curriculum. A qualitative framework was adopted using three
   methods: focus-group discussions, reflection based on a video recording
   and a critical analysis of the curriculum. Findings suggest that
   incremental shifts in critical self-awareness of business education
   pre-service teachers occurred. A business education and education for
   sustainability synthesis is recommended and provided as a conceptual
   framework in this study. This synthesis can be a useful place to start
   to elicit critical self-awareness when pre-service teachers have to deal
   with the complex mix of the five types of learning, namely disciplinary,
   situational, practical, fundamental and pedagogical learning.},

Title = {Collaborative e-Learning Using Streaming Video and Asynchronous
   Discussion Boards to Teach the Cognitive Foundation of Medical
   Interviewing: A Case Study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MEDICAL INTERNET RESEARCH},
Year = {2003},
Volume = {5},
Number = {2},
Abstract = {Background: Advances in electronic technology have created opportunities
   for new instructional designs of medical curricula.
   Objective: We created and evaluated a 4-week online elective course for
   medical students to teach the cognitive basis for interviewing skills.
   Methods: Ten students, from 2 medical schools, studied online modules on
   interviewing concepts and viewed videos illustrating the concepts. They
   then participated in asynchronous discussion groups designed to
   reinforce course concepts, stimulate reflective learning, and promote
   peer learning.
   Results: In qualitative evaluations, learners reported improvements in
   self-awareness; increased understanding of interviewing concepts; and
   benefits of online learning vs face to face learning. Participants
   reported high levels of satisfaction with online learning and with
   achievement of course objectives. Self-reported knowledge scores
   increased significantly from pre-course completion to post-course
   completion.
   Conclusions: Online education has significant potential to augment
   curriculum on the medical interview, particularly among students trained
   in community settings geographically distant from their academic medical
   center.},

Journal = {SPORT EDUCATION AND SOCIETY},

Abstract = {This qualitative study aimed to describe the collaborative process
   followed by an in-service teacher and two university researchers in
   co-designing and implementing a Health-based Physical Education/Sport
   Education hybridization and to explore the perceived
   strengths/weaknesses of the process. An 11-lesson (six weeks)
   intervention on rope-skipping was conducted in a 5th-grade classroom.
   Qualitative data was collected (teacher's interviews, participant
   observation and video recording) and analysed using a multiphase
   approach combining inductive and deductive (based on models features and
   intervention's pedagogical principles) thematic content analysis and
   constant comparison. Self-reflective cycles were applied to reinforce
   the teaching-learning process by sharing professional knowledge and
   reflections. Results revealed that the collaboration with researchers
   helped the teacher to check whether it was consistent with the models'
   goals and critical elements and readjust her practice. The teacher was
   crucial to the co-design and adaptation of the hybridized models to the
   local context due to her knowledge of the school and pupils. From the
   collaborative team's perspective, her role during the implementation
   fostered group co-responsibility, respect for students' different motor
   competencies, and transference of practice beyond the school timetable.
   This contributed to encouraging students' physical activity involvement
   in an informed and autonomous way. However, a longer initial `Guidance
   stage' was deemed essential to help students learn basic concepts and
   skills to better progress in an informed and self-managed way. Longer
   interventions and research are necessary to delve deeper into the
   understanding of pedagogical models. A collaborative approach may help
   teachers to face initial involvement in the pedagogical models'
   implementation.},

Title = {The Equivalence of Video Self-review Versus Debriefing After Simulation:
   Can Faculty Resources Be Reallocated?},

Abstract = {IntroductionTraditional simulation debriefing is both time- and
   resource-intensive. Shifting the degree of primary learning
   responsibility from the faculty to the learner through self-guided
   learning has received greater attention as a means of reducing this
   resource intensity. The aim of the study was to determine if
   video-assisted self-debriefing, as a form of self-guided learning, would
   have equivalent learning outcomes compared to standard debriefing.
   MethodsThis randomized cohort study consisting of 49 PGY-1 to -3
   emergency medicine residents compared performance after video
   self-assessment utilizing an observer checklist versus standard
   debriefing for simulated emergency department procedural sedation
   (EDPS). The primary outcome measure was performance on the second EDPS
   scenario.
   ResultsIndependent-samples t-test found that both control (standard
   debrief) and intervention (video self-assessment) groups demonstrated
   significantly increased scores on Scenario 2 (standard-t(40) = 2.20, p <
   0.05; video-t(45) = 3.88, p < 0.05). There was a large and significant
   positive correlation between faculty and resident self-evaluation (r =
   0.70, p < 0.05). There was no significant difference between faculty and
   residents self-assessment mean scores (t(24) = 1.90, p = 0.07).
   ConclusionsResidents receiving feedback on their performance via
   video-assisted self-debriefing improved their performance in simulated
   EDPS to the same degree as with standard faculty debriefing.
   Video-assisted self-debriefing is a promising avenue for leveraging the
   benefits of simulation-based training with reduced resource
   requirements.},

Title = {Self-Observation and Peer Feedback as a Faculty Development Approach for
   Problem-Based Learning Tutors: A Program Evaluation},
Journal = {TEACHING AND LEARNING IN MEDICINE},
Year = {2017},
Volume = {29},
Number = {3},
Pages = {313-325},
Abstract = {Problem: Good teaching requires spontaneous, immediate, and appropriate
   action in response to various situations. It is even more crucial in
   problem-based learning (PBL) tutorials, as the tutors, while directing
   students toward the identification and attainment of learning
   objectives, must stimulate them to contribute to the process and provide
   them with constructive feedback. PBL tutors in medicine lack
   opportunities to receive feedback from their peers on their teaching
   strategies. Moreover, as tutorials provide little or no time to stop and
   think, more could be learned by reflecting on the experience than from
   the experience itself. We designed and evaluated a faculty development
   approach to developing PBL tutors that combined self-reflection and peer
   feedback processes, both powerful techniques for improving performance
   in education. Intervention: We developed an observation instrument for
   PBL facilitation to be used both by tutors to self-observe and reflect
   on own teaching strategies and by peers to observe and provide feedback
   to tutors. Twenty PBL sessions were video-recorded. Tutors completed the
   instrument immediately after their PBL session and again while watching
   their video-recorded session (self-observation). A group of three
   observers completed the instrument while watching each recorded session
   and provided feedback to each tutor (peer observation and feedback). We
   investigated tutors' perceptions of the feasibility and acceptability of
   the approach and gathered data on its effectiveness in enhancing tutors'
   facilitation skills. Context: The preclinical medical curriculum at the
   University of Geneva is essentially taught by PBL. A new program of
   faculty development based on self-observation and peer feedback was
   offered to voluntary tutors and evaluated. Outcome: Our results suggest
   that self-observation and peer feedback, supported by an instrument, can
   be effective in enhancing tutors' facilitation skills. Reflection on
   self-observation raised teachers' awareness of the effectiveness of the
   strategies they used to foster student learning. This motivated a need
   to change their teaching practice. However, for the changes to become
   operative, peer feedback was required, providing the cues and strategies
   needed to improve the facilitation skills. Lessons Learned: Peer
   coaching was considered feasible and useful to improve tutors'
   facilitation skills. Evaluating the program made it possible to assess
   tutors' needs and the reasons underlying their difficulties, and this in
   turn provided the basis for advanced workshops. Nonetheless, aspects
   related to logistics and the time constraints of such an individualized
   approach, as well as the cultural appropriation of peer coaching, might
   be obstacles that need to be addressed.},

Title = {A scenario-based web app to facilitate patient education in lung tumor
   patients undergoing video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery: Development
   and usability testing},
Journal = {DIGITAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Abstract = {Background Patient education (PE) is essential for improving patients'
   knowledge, anxiety, and satisfaction, and supporting their postoperative
   recovery. However, the advantages of video-assisted thoracoscopic
   surgery (VATS)-smaller incisions and faster recovery-can result in
   shorter hospital stays, making PE more challenging to implement
   effectively. Multimedia PE can potentially enhance PE, but its
   effectiveness for patients undergoing VATS is unclear.Objective This
   study developed a scenario-based PE web app for lung tumor patients
   undergoing VATS (SPE-VATS) to facilitate the PE process and evaluated
   its usability through a clinical trial.Methods The SPE-VATS provided the
   experimental group (EG: 32 participants) with interactive scenario,
   query guidance, diagnostic analysis, experience sharing, and active
   reminder, while the control group (CG: 32 participants) used pamphlets
   and videos. The usability of SPE-VATS in terms of postoperative anxiety
   reduction and patient satisfaction with the app was evaluated using
   self-reported questionnaires based on the state-trait anxiety inventory,
   technology acceptance model, system usability scale, and task load
   index.Results There was no statistically significant difference in
   postoperative anxiety reduction between the EG and CG, possibly because
   90\% of the participants underwent a low-risk surgical type, and VATS is
   known to be advantageous in alleviating surgical anxiety. However,
   females and higher educated EG participants showed a non-significant but
   favorable reduction than their CG counterparts. Moreover, the EG was
   highly satisfied with the app (rated 4.2 to 4.4 out of 5.0), with no
   significant gender and education level difference. They particularly
   valued the interactive scenario, experience sharing, and diagnostic
   analysis features of SPE-VATS.Conclusions The SPE-VATS demonstrated its
   usability and high patient satisfaction, particularly for female and
   higher educated patients. Low-risk patient predominance and VATS's
   advantages may explain non-significant postoperative anxiety reduction,
   warranting further studies on high-risk patients to evaluate the impact
   of SPE-VATS on clinical practice.},

Title = {Providing insights into health data science education through artificial
   intelligence},
Journal = {BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 23},
Abstract = {Background Health Data Science (HDS) is a novel interdisciplinary field
   that integrates biological, clinical, and computational sciences with
   the aim of analysing clinical and biological data through the
   utilisation of computational methods. Training healthcare specialists
   who are knowledgeable in both health and data sciences is highly
   required, important, and challenging. Therefore, it is essential to
   analyse students' learning experiences through artificial intelligence
   techniques in order to provide both teachers and learners with insights
   about effective learning strategies and to improve existing HDS course
   designs.Methods We applied artificial intelligence methods to uncover
   learning tactics and strategies employed by students in an HDS massive
   open online course with over 3,000 students enrolled. We also used
   statistical tests to explore students' engagement with different
   resources (such as reading materials and lecture videos) and their level
   of engagement with various HDS topics.Results We found that students in
   HDS employed four learning tactics, such as actively connecting new
   information to their prior knowledge, taking assessments and practising
   programming to evaluate their understanding, collaborating with their
   classmates, and repeating information to memorise. Based on the employed
   tactics, we also found three types of learning strategies, including low
   engagement (Surface learners), moderate engagement (Strategic learners),
   and high engagement (Deep learners), which are in line with well-known
   educational theories. The results indicate that successful students
   allocate more time to practical topics, such as projects and
   discussions, make connections among concepts, and employ peer
   learning.Conclusions We applied artificial intelligence techniques to
   provide new insights into HDS education. Based on the findings, we
   provide pedagogical suggestions not only for course designers but also
   for teachers and learners that have the potential to improve the
   learning experience of HDS students.},

Abstract = {Autism, also known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (or ASD), is a
   neurological disorder. Its main symptoms include difficulty in
   verbal/non-verbal communication and rigid/repetitive behavior. These
   symptoms are often indistinguishable from a normal (control) individual
   due to which this disorder remains undiagnosed in early childhood, thus
   leading to a delayed treatment. Since the learning curve is steep during
   the initial years, an early diagnosis of autism would allow to make an
   early intervention, which in turn would positively affect the growth of
   an autistic child. Further, the traditional methods of autism diagnosis
   require multiple visits to a specialized doctor; however, this process
   is generally time-consuming. In this paper, we present a learning-based
   approach to automate autism diagnosis using simple and small action
   video clips of subjects. This task is particularly challenging because
   the amount of annotated data available is small, and the variations
   among samples from the two categories (ASD and control) are generally
   indistinguishable. This is also evident from poor performance of a
   baseline binary classifier on this task. To address this, we propose to
   adopt contrastive feature learning for the first time on this task and
   demonstrate a significant increase in the prediction accuracy. We
   further validate this by conducting thorough experimental analyses in
   both self-supervised and supervised setups on two publicly available
   datasets. We have also released our codes and pre-trained models for
   reproducibility.},

Number = {4},
Abstract = {Video games are useful learning tools in different fields. This work
   seeks to evaluate, through a self-developed video game, their usefulness
   as a learning tool for the information literacy of undergraduate
   students. The videogame ``The last exam{''} was developed after the
   analysis of 1,639 user queries registered over 2 years at the
   Complutense University Library, and aims to answer queries common to
   other university libraries. To evaluate its impact, a single-group pilot
   experiment was carried out with 14 undergraduate students using a
   pre-test/post-test validated by experts. The results show significant
   improvements in the students' information skills, as well as positive
   evaluations of the exercise. We conclude that the incorporation of video
   games as a complement to the content of library training programs can be
   beneficial, especially as an introduction or for reinforcement or
   evaluation.},

Abstract = {Self-Supervised Video Hashing (SSVH) models learn to generate short
   binary representations for videos without ground-truth supervision,
   facilitating large-scale video retrieval efficiency and attracting
   increasing research attention. The success of SSVH lies in the
   understanding of video content and the ability to capture the semantic
   relation among unlabeled videos. Typically, state-of-the-art SSVH
   methods consider these two points in a two-stage training pipeline,
   where they firstly train an auxiliary network by instance-wise
   mask-and-predict tasks and secondly train a hashing model to preserve
   the pseudo-neighborhood structure transferred from the auxiliary
   network. This consecutive training strategy is inflexible and also
   unnecessary. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective one-stage
   SSVH method called ConMH, which incorporates video semantic information
   and video similarity relationship understanding in a single stage. To
   capture video semantic information, we adopt an encoder-decoder
   structure to reconstruct the video from its temporal-masked frames.
   Particularly, we find that a higher masking ratio helps video
   understanding. Besides, we fully exploit the similarity relationship
   between videos by maximizing agreement between two augmented views of a
   video, which contributes to more discriminative and robust hash codes.
   Extensive experiments on three large-scale video datasets (i.e., FCVID,
   ActivityNet and YFCC) indicate that ConMH achieves state-of-the-art
   results. Code is available at https://github.com/ huangmozhi9527/ConMH.},

Abstract = {This study explores the integration of generative AI, specifically
   ChatGPT, in self-directed language learning (SDLL) as perceived by
   YouTube content creators. Through thematic analysis of in-depth
   interviews with 14 prominent online language educators with related

   perceptions of GenAI as a tool for SDLL, (2) strategies that they
   recommend to effectively utilize ChatGPT for enhancing SDLL, and (3) the
   guidelines they suggest for fostering SDLL with AI. The findings show
   that YouTube-based language educators acknowledged ChatGPT as a vital
   tool for SDLL as it offers availability, versatility, and transformative
   potential. Besides linguistic benefits, ChatGPT enhances SDLL
   experiences by generating contextually relevant responses and fostering
   meaningful conversations and learner growth. The study highlights the
   importance of addressing ethical, pedagogical, and sociocultural factors
   when incorporating AI in SDL and educators' critical role in
   facilitating learners' navigation through the evolving landscape of SDL

Title = {Medical Students' Perception and Perceived Value of Peer Learning in
   Undergraduate Clinical Skill Development and Assessment: Mixed Methods
   Study},
Journal = {JMIR MEDICAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {7},
Number = {3},
Month = {JUL-SEP},
Abstract = {Background: The effectiveness of peer learning in clinical skill
   development is well recognized and researched, given the many benefits
   gained such as enhanced learning, alleviation of the burden on faculty,
   and early development of teaching skills for future doctors. However,
   little is known in terms of its effectiveness as an assessment tool and
   the extent to which peer assessment can be relied upon in the absence of
   faculty support.
   Objective: This study was conducted to assess medical students'
   perception toward peer learning, which is based on self-regulated
   learning as a tool of assessment, and to compare peer evaluation with
   faculty evaluation of clinical skill performance.
   Methods: A cohort of 36 third-year medical students were exposed to peer
   learning (same-level) in clinical skills education for 3 months. A
   convergent mixed methods approach was adapted to collect data from 3
   sources, namely, students' perception of peer learning, performance
   scores, and reflective observational analysis. A 5-point Likert-type
   scale was used to assess students' (n=28) perception on the value of
   peer learning. The students were asked to assess their peers by using a
   preset checklist on clinical skill performance, and scores were compared
   to faculty assessment scores. Reflective observational data were
   collected from observing video recordings of some of the peer learning
   sessions. The findings from all 3 sources were integrated using joint
   display analysis.
   Results: Out of 28 students, 25 students completed the survey and 20
   students perceived peer learning as valuable in clinical skills
   education. The mean score of peer assessment was higher than that of
   faculty assessment. There was a significant difference in student
   performance between supervised teaching and peer learning groups
   (P=.003). Most students focused on the mastery of skill with little
   attention to the technique's quality. Further, students were unable to
   appreciate the relevance of the potential clinical findings of physical
   examination.
   Conclusions: Peer learning in clinical skills education, based on
   self-regulated learning, empowers students to develop a more responsible
   approach toward their education. However, peer assessment is
   insufficient to evaluate clinical skill performance in the absence of
   faculty support. Therefore, we recommend that peer learning activities
   be preceded by supervised faculty-taught sessions.},

Title = {Promoting Science Affinities through a Video Project in a Science,
   Technology, and Society (STS) Learning Approach},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Abstract = {Lack of awareness about the interconnections between Science,
   Technology, and Society and students' dislike of studying science have
   led to many environmental and social problems. During the COVID-19
   Pandemic, students experienced difficulties accessing educational
   resources and demanded new programs to support their academic science
   experiences. This study designed a science outreach program, a video
   project competition using a science, technology, and society (STS)
   learning approach and explored its effects on 13 randomly selected
   students (Grades 4-11). This video project employed three foundational
   theories- identity formation, attitudes toward science, and growth
   mindset-to increase students' affinities in science and assess the
   program's effects. Pre-and post-survey data showed that the video
   project using the STS approach did not have statistically meaningful
   effects on the participants who had high achievement in STEM areas.
   However, their interviews suggested that this study helped to sustain
   and increase their affinities and science learning even during the
   Pandemic by involving them in the learning process, understanding
   Science and Technology in our society, and making decisions for
   society's future.},

Title = {Using learning analytics to evaluate a video-based lecture series},
Journal = {MEDICAL TEACHER},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {40},
Number = {1},
Pages = {91-98},
Abstract = {Background: The video-based lecture (VBL), an important component of the
   flipped classroom (FC) and massive open online course (MOOC) approaches
   to medical education, has primarily been evaluated through direct
   learner feedback. Evaluation may be enhanced through learner analytics
   (LA) - analysis of quantitative audience usage data generated by
   video-sharing platforms.Methods and results: We applied LA to an
   experimental series of ten VBLs on electroencephalography (EEG)
   interpretation, uploaded to YouTube in the model of a publicly
   accessible MOOC. Trends in view count; total percentage of video viewed
   and audience retention (AR) (percentage of viewers watching at a time
   point compared to the initial total) were examined. The pattern of
   average AR decline was characterized using regression analysis,
   revealing a uniform linear decline in viewership for each video, with no
   evidence of an optimal VBL length. Segments with transient increases in
   AR corresponded to those focused on core concepts, indicative of content
   requiring more detailed evaluation. We propose a model for applying LA
   at four levels: global, series, video, and feedback.Discussion and
   conclusions: LA may be a useful tool in evaluating a VBL series. Our
   proposed model combines analytics data and learner self-report for
   comprehensive evaluation.},

Volume = {58},

Pages = {36-46},
Month = {JAN 2},
Abstract = {Tutors have an important teaching role in higher education (HE), but
   rarely receive professional development beyond one-off generic workshops
   or seminars. Any feedback on their teaching is typically in the form of
   an evaluation, rather than focussed on enhancing tutors' teaching
   practice. To address this gap, we devised a professional development
   programme that incorporated video-recorded observations, informal
   student feedback, self-reflection, and peer mentoring. Twelve tutors and
   six mentors participated in the programme. Data included focus group
   interviews and audio-recorded meetings between mentors and tutors.
   Benefits to tutors included enhanced self-reflection, collegiality,
   increased confidence in teaching ability, and positive outcomes for
   their students' learning. The interdisciplinary pairing of tutors and
   mentors resulted in dialogue that was non-evaluative, supportive, and
   collegial. We argue that video-recorded observations combined with peer
   mentoring and student feedback can enhance teaching quality by providing
   tutors with contextual, relevant, and individualised professional
   development.},

Abstract = {The use of multimedia technology tools has become a key issue for the
   application of educational technology in physical activity and sport,
   contributing to a more efficient, accessible university education and
   greater motivation for students and teachers. Establishing criteria for
   the selection of technological instruments appropriate to the
   pedagogical context of the development of the experience, the objective
   of this research was to analyze the technological acceptance by students
   of the subject of Physical Education of the degree in computer science
   engineering that applies different technological tools in their training
   process. The study uses a descriptive cross section design. 89 students
   between 19 and 21 years old participated, evaluated through the
   Technology Acceptance Model questionnaire and a self-registration
   questionnaire. These data were analyzed through the SPSS software and
   the acceptance levels of the technology and its relationship with
   sociodemographic variables were studied. The results indicate that most
   of the students reported being satisfied with the use of the Kinovea
   technological tool, not observing significant differences according to
   age, gender and user level. It is concluded that the students consider
   that the use of technological tools has a positive influence on their
   learning and performance.},

Title = {Pedagogical discourse markers in online algebra learning: Unraveling
   instructor's communication using natural language processing},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {205},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Despite the proliferation of video-based instruction and its
   benefits-such as promoting student autonomy and self-paced learning-the
   complexities of online teaching remain a challenge. To be effective,
   educators require extensive training in digital teaching methodologies.
   As such, there's a pressing need to examine and comprehend the
   intricacies of instructors' communication patterns within this context.
   This research addresses the pressing need to understand pedagogical
   discourse in online video lectures in Algebra classes by employing
   computational linguistic tools and natural language processing (NLP).
   Using transcripts from 125 Algebra 1 video lectures-comprising 4962
   instances of pedagogical discourse-from five instructors at Math Nation,
   a virtual math learning environment, we analyzed the conveyance of
   linguistic, attitudinal, and emotional nuances. With the aid of 26
   Coh-Metrix and S \& PRIME;EANCE features, we classified educators'
   language choices, achieving an accuracy of 86.7\%. Furthermore,
   variations in language choices, as signified by discourse markers, were
   examined through a K-means clustering approach. The resulting 17
   clusters were grouped into interpersonal, structural, and cognitive
   pedagogic functions. Through this exploration, we demonstrate the
   promising potential of NLP in efficiently deciphering pedagogical
   communication patterns in video lectures. These insights open a new
   avenue for research, aimed at assessing the efficacy of digital
   instruction by scrutinizing pedagogical discourse characteristics in
   computer-based learning environments.},

Title = {Students' attitude towards the use of educational video games to develop
   competencies},
Journal = {COMPUTERS IN HUMAN BEHAVIOR},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {81},
Pages = {366-377},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The use of educational video games (EVGs) is gaining momentum as a means
   to motivate and to engage students in their learning process.
   Nevertheless, previous research is taking for granted that students have
   a positive attitude towards EVGs and did not ensure a proper
   understanding of students' characteristics that might influence their
   attitude towards them. Therefore, this study's main goal is to explore
   four students' characteristics (perceived relevance, perceived
   confidence, media affinity, and perceived self-efficacy) that influence
   students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies.
   Using the fsQCA method to analyze data gathered on a sample of 128
   undergraduate students we delve into different configurations underlying
   students' positive and negative attitude towards the use of EVGs. Main
   results suggest three configurations leading to a positive attitude with
   perceived, relevance being a necessary and sufficient condition for
   students' positive attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop their
   competencies. Four configurations were found to condition a negative
   attitude suggesting that equifinality can be considered when explaining
   students' attitude towards the use of EVGs to develop competencies.
   Implications for teachers, limitations of the study, and future research
   lines are addressed at the end of the paper. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All

Abstract = {Background/Objectives Breast neoplasm is one of the most common cancers
   in Iranian women due to the late diagnosis. Awareness of breast neoplasm
   and using Breast Self-Examination (BSE) assist in the early detection
   and treatment of cancer. This study examined the effectiveness of
   video-based multimedia training versus face-to-face training in
   awareness of breast neoplasm and BSE and possible factors affecting
   their effectiveness. Methods This research was a pre-test, a post-test
   experimental study comparing the knowledge, attitude, and performance of
   women about BSE across two training intervention groups (face-to-face
   versus video-based multimedia). The study was conducted at Shiraz
   University of Medical Sciences (SUMS), and 100 women between 20 to 60
   years old were allocated to each intervention group via multi-stage
   cluster sampling (n:110). Three valid and reliable researcher-made
   questioners were used. Data were analyzed using SPSS 24 with independent
   t-test, paired t-test, and ANOVA. Results Both video-based multimedia
   and face-to-face training methods significantly increased the
   participant's knowledge, attitude, and skills about breast
   self-examination (P < 0.001). In the sub-categories, the results showed
   that the face-to-face training improved negligence and forgetfulness in
   applying BSE (P = 0.03) and correcting or modifying the previous
   knowledge around the issue (P = 0.02). The effect of the video-based
   method on participants with university education was more than on
   non-university (P = 0.04). Conclusion Incorporating video-based
   multimedia training in awareness of breast neoplasm and breast
   self-examination provides an easy, flexible, and affordable way for
   detection, particularly considering crisis restrictions. This can be of
   particular attention in more populated, developing/low-income countries
   and rural and remote areas to enhance equitable access to training and
   facilitation diagnosis and treatment if applicable.},

Title = {Rehearsal-based digital serious boardgame versus a game-free e-learning
   tool for anatomical education: Quasi-randomized controlled trial},

Abstract = {Serious games may resolve problems relating to low motivation in complex
   medical topics such as anatomy. However, they remain relatively novel
   introductions to the science of learning, and further research is
   required to ascertain their benefits. This study describes the overall
   development and testing of a digital serious boardgame designed to
   facilitate the rehearsal of musculoskeletal anatomy based on
   self-determination theory with considerations for the psychological
   state of Flow. It was hypothesized that students assigned to the
   intervention game condition would attain higher Flow scores, a measure
   of engagement and intrinsic motivation, than students assigned to the
   game-free control, and that the intervention condition would report
   either superior or non-superior, but not inferior, scores on a surprise
   recall test. A total of 36 second-year undergraduate medical students
   participated in the quasi-randomized controlled trial, where the
   intervention groups went first and randomly drew questions that were
   mirrored into the control groups. All students were administered an
   identical 10-question baseline assessment before their interventions,
   the Short Flow Scale immediately after, and a surprise test four-to-six
   weeks later. Independent samples t-tests indicated that students of both
   conditions were of similar baseline knowledge (t = 0.7, p = 0.47),
   significantly higher Flow scores in the game condition (t = 2.99, p =
   0.01), and no significant differences between surprise test scores (t =
   -0.3, p = 0.75). The game appears to be an appropriate game-based tool
   for student rehearsal of anatomical education, stemming from a strong
   theoretical base that facilitates high engagement and intrinsic
   motivation.},

Abstract = {Research demonstrates that combining video modeling and visual activity
   schedules into video activity schedules has been effective in increasing
   independence for students with disabilities. However, the instructional
   procedures used to teach students to acquire the necessary skills to
   navigate those tools vary among existent research. In this study, a
   behavior skills training package was investigated within a multiple
   probe design across participants, to determine if four elementary aged
   participants with intellectual disability could acquire self-instruction
   skills to navigate a video activity schedule. Three participants
   acquired the self-instruction skills using behavior skills training.
   After learning how to navigate the video activity schedules, the same
   three participants generalized and maintained the self-instruction
   skills to perform additional novel behaviors. The results suggest that
   behavior skills training may be an effective instructional strategy for
   teaching self-instruction skills and a means to program for generalized

Abstract = {Multimedia is ubiquitous in 21st-century education. Cognitive load
   theory and the cognitive theory of multimedia learning both postulate
   that the quality of multimedia design heavily influences learning. We
   sought to identify how to best design multimedia and review how well
   those learning theories held up to meta-analyses. We conducted an
   overview of systematic reviews that tested the effects of multimedia
   design on learning or cognitive load. We found 29 reviews including
   1,189 studies and 78,177 participants. We found 11 design principles
   that demonstrated significant, positive, meta-analytic effects on
   learning and five that significantly improved management of cognitive
   load. The largest benefits were for captioning second-language videos,
   temporal/spatial contiguity, and signaling. We also found robust
   evidence for modality, animation, coherence/removing seductive details,
   anthropomorphics, segmentation, personalization, pedagogical agents, and
   verbal redundancy effects. Good design was more important for more
   complex materials, and in system-paced environments (e.g., lectures)
   than self-paced ones (e.g., websites). Results supported many tenets of
   both theories. We highlight a range of evidence-based strategies that
   could be implemented by educators.},

Abstract = {The Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE) is designed to
   assess medical students' skills and attitude competencies before
   clinical practice. However, no method of reflective learning using
   video-based content has been used in OSCE education. This study aimed to
   confirm whether using smart glasses-based educational content is
   effective for OSCE reflective learning using multiple views (patient,
   student, and overall). This educational intervention study included a
   control group exposed to the traditional learning method and an
   intervention group exposed to a learning method incorporating smart
   glasses. Participants were 117 (72 in the control group and 45 in the
   intervention group) third-year radiological technology students
   scheduled to take the OSCE and 70 (37 in the control group and 33 in the
   intervention group) who met the eligibility criteria. Mock OSCEs were
   administered before and after the educational intervention (traditional
   and smart glasses-based education) to investigate changes in scores.
   After the educational intervention, a self-reported comprehension survey
   and a questionnaire were administered on the effectiveness of the
   video-based content from different views for student reflective
   learning. Unexpectedly, the OSCE evaluation score after the preliminary
   investigation significantly increased for the smart glasses control
   group (0.36 +/- 0.1) compared to the intervention group (0.06 +/- 0.1)
   setting up the radiographic conditions (x-ray center and detector
   center; p = 0.042). The intervention group's lower score in the mock
   OSCEs may have been due to the discomfort of wearing the smart glasses
   to perform the radiography procedure and their unfamiliarity with the
   smart glasses, which may have affected their concentration. The findings
   suggest that smart glasses-based education for OSCEs can be improved
   (e.g., being easy to handle and use and trouble-free).},

Title = {Cultural competence learning of the health care students using
   simulation pedagogy: An integrative review},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {52},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The objective of this literature review was to identify the current
   evidence available on the learning of cultural competence among health
   care students using simulation pedagogy. An integrative literature
   review was conducted systematically. The CINAHL, PubMed and ERIC
   databases were searched for articles published between 2009 and 2019,
   resulting in including 17 articles in the review. The data were analyzed
   using descriptive synthesis. The participants of most of the studies
   were nursing students. The used simulation methods included lowand
   high-fidelity simulations, standardized patients, virtual and
   video-streamed simulations and role-play. The educational contents
   involved assessing advanced communication skills or focusing on
   patients' socioeconomic, cultural and environmental needs in care. The
   learning outcomes included knowledge of cultural competence, culturally
   competent communication skills, culturally competent nursing skills,
   self-awareness of cultural diversity and self-efficacy in diverse
   cultural situations. A variety of simulation methods has been used in
   the cultural competence education and produced several learning
   outcomes, including an improved understanding of cross-cultural
   communication and encouragement to discuss various culturally bound
   health issues. Further research is needed to find an effective
   combination of teaching methods using innovative ways to foster learning
   cultural competence.},

Abstract = {Interactive Web Environments and multimedia tools are very common in
   engineering studies. However, these resources are very limited when
   graphical resolution is needed during the learning process. A learning
   environment that combines video and self-assessment Computer-Aided
   Design (CAD) tools was developed to analyse this problem and to
   determine if the combined use of these two tools may be important in
   learning these subjects. A comparative study of 124 engineering students
   was carried out. They were randomly assigned into three groups: Group-A
   using only traditional tools, Group-B using traditional tools and CAD
   tools, and Group-C using traditional tools, CAD tools, and video
   training. The statistical analysis of the results showed that a greater
   number of students of Group-C passed the test and improved their scores.
   Therefore, the combined use of these two types of resources can be an
   important aid in the study of subjects requiring graphic tools for their
   learning.},

Abstract = {Background: Teaching methods have failed to keep up with the pace of the
   changing curriculum. Clinical practice, an essential part of nursing
   education, links theory with practice, particularly in midwifery
   nursing. Thus, this study aimed to compare the effects of video-assisted
   teaching programs and traditional demonstration on nursing students
   learning obstetrical palpation skills. Materials and Methods: This is a
   quasi-experimental research work with pretest, posttest, control group
   design in which 60 third-year students of Bachelor of Science in Nursing
   were selected and assigned randomly, by lottery method, into an
   experimental group (video-assisted teaching program) and a control group
   (traditional demonstration) regarding obstetrical palpation. The data
   were collected through a self-designed rating scale. The validity of the
   rating scale was established by a panel of seven experts from the field
   of obstetrical and gynecological nursing, and the reliability was
   established through Cronbach's. (0.78), which showed the tool was
   consistent among the population. Results: The results showed a
   significant difference between the pretest and posttest skill scores of
   students who were exposed to video-assisted teaching program and
   traditional demonstration (t = 18.35, p < 0.001). Although both the
   methods were equally effective in enhancing skill, traditional
   demonstration scored much better than the video-assisted teaching
   program when the posttest skills were compared (t = 36.40, p = 0.001).
   Conclusions: The routine educational method, i.e., demonstration, is
   more effective in developing skills emphasizing the reinforcement of
   academicians in enhancing teaching skills by adopting blended teaching
   technique for enhancing memory storage, retrieval, cognition, and
   learning.},

Abstract = {Hand-raising signals students' willingness to participate actively in
   the classroom discourse. It has been linked to academic achievement and
   cognitive engagement of students and constitutes an observable indicator
   of behavioral engagement. However, due to the large amount of effort
   involved in manual hand-raising annotation by human observers, research
   on this phenomenon, enabling teachers to understand and foster active
   classroom participation, is still scarce. An automated detection
   approach of hand-raising events in classroom videos can offer a time-
   and cost-effective substitute for manual coding. From a technical
   perspective, the main challenges for automated detection in the
   classroom setting are diverse camera angles and student occlusions. In
   this work, we propose utilizing and further extending a novel
   view-invariant, occlusion-robust machine learning approach with long
   short-term memory networks for hand-raising detection in classroom
   videos based on body pose estimation. We employed a dataset stemming
   from 36 realworld classroom videos, capturing 127 students from grades 5
   to 12 and 2442 manually annotated authentic hand-raising events. Our
   temporal model trained on body pose embeddings achieved an F1 score of
   0.76. When employing this approach for the automated annotation of
   handraising instances, a mean absolute error of 3.76 for the number of
   detected hand-raisings per student, per lesson was achieved. We
   demonstrate its application by investigating the relationship between
   hand-raising events and self-reported cognitive engagement, situational
   interest, and involvement using manually annotated and automatically
   detected hand-raising instances. Furthermore, we discuss the potential
   of our approach to enable future large-scale research on student
   participation, as well as privacy-preserving data collection in the
   classroom context.},

Abstract = {In most organizations, live presentations are common practices. This
   represents a huge amount of knowledge. However, it is not available
   after the presentation. The present paper describes the development of
   online courses created by enhancing video recordings of live
   presentations.
   This creation process happened in the context of an international
   organization. It started in 2008. There were three waves of
   presentations that were converted to video courses: first, around 30
   socalled ``scientific seminars{''} by staff experts or guests
   specialists intended to increase the scientific knowledge of staff
   members; second, around 20 technical presentations by researchers
   intended to explain the deliverable of their R\&D projects; third, a
   presentation repeatedly made for newcomers converted to a consolidated
   didactic video.
   There are several purposes for creating online video courses from live
   presentations. The first is to increase the number of viewers for each
   presentation. When a presentation becomes a course, it can be repeated
   for other audiences and for other people through internet. People who
   watch these videos gain time not only because they do not have to travel
   to attend, but also because the enhanced videos are condensed versions
   of the presentations. The second purpose is to give an opportunity to
   live/deferred attendees to deepen their understanding by revisiting the
   presentation. The third purpose is to help the speakers by giving them
   feedback, allowing them to check what they say and to use their recorded
   presentation for other people.
   These purposes were achieved by enhancing the didactic features of the
   original recordings. This paper details three kinds of video
   enhancements: reduction of duration, audio improvement and visual
   improvement. It also details some of the measures taken to prepare the
   recordings so that the enhancements could be even more efficient. The
   special case of consolidated videos based on multiple instances of the
   same live presentation is also discussed.
   The main conclusion is threefold. First, making a video out of a live
   presentation is an opportunity to enhance the didactic power of the
   original live presentation. Second, the time gained by those who watch
   and use the video outweighs the time spent on enhancing the video.
   Third, the video enhancement of live presentations requires skills and
   expertise in video and didactic communication. It could become a new
   specialized job in the field of educational technologies.
   Eventually, the major criterion of success is probably the enhancement
   in terms of self-esteem in that the speaker can be proud of the enhanced
   video of his/her presentation.},

Abstract = {Technology that delivers an immersive experience in education offers a
   viable alternative to in-person teaching. This study aims to compare
   learning from a clinical encounter viewed in a virtual reality
   360-degree headset to that of a traditional monitor by quantifying the
   user experience and testing what was learnt. Furthermore, experiential
   learning is described as a key concept in simulation practice, and this
   is explored using transcripts of participants' experiences with
   360-degree video. We could determine no statistical difference between
   median exam scores between groups (p =0.25), and there was no
   correlation found between total immersion and motivational scores with
   exam performance (Rho = -0.14 p = 0.18, Rho= 0.08 p = 0.31). However,
   those viewing 360 media reported significantly higher immersion,
   motivation, and empathy scores (p < 0.05). Domains based upon Kolb's
   learning cycle generated themes including engagement, communication, and
   self-efficacy. 360 video creates an immersive experience with an
   associated high-value motivational position; however, this could not be
   translated to an increase in exam scores. There are benefits to
   perceived learning and emotional content with 360 videos, although,
   pedagogical theory needs further understanding if educators are to embed
   new immersive technology in curriculums.},

Title = {Rethinking approaches to reflection in initial teacher education},

Abstract = {BackgroundDuring initial teacher education, reflective thinking can have
   a key role to play in preparing pre-service teachers for professional
   practice. Therefore, the approaches taken to assist reflection are
   important to optimise learning from classroom experiences.PurposeThis
   case study from Finland sought to examine the development of pre-service
   teachers' reflective thinking during a teaching practicum in which a
   non-prescriptive, self-guided approach to reflection was
   implemented.MethodDrawing on best practice, we designed an approach to
   reflection which placed emphasis on the agency of the pre-service
   teacher, and involved elements including dialogue, peer interaction and
   collaboration, and video. The research followed three pre-service
   teachers who worked in a peer group with their mentor-teacher during a
   six-week teaching practicum where this approach was employed. The
   peer-group mentoring discussions were recorded and analysed
   qualitatively.FindingsThe in-depth analysis of data identified three
   different sequences of self-guided reflection phases, with findings
   revealing how the pre-service teachers' reflective thinking developed
   according to their individual and shared trajectories. It suggests that
   for practicum experiences to be reflected on in a way that supports deep
   learning, the process must stem from pre-service teachers'
   individualised learning needs.ConclusionsThis case study highlights the
   rich potential of a non-prescriptive, self-guided approach to reflection
   as a tool for use during initial teacher education. It can offer a more
   personalised and active way for pre-service teachers to learn from early
   teaching experiences, gain practical understanding and develop their
   reflective thinking.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Regular assessments are recommended to identify
   individuals requiring additional resuscitation training. We developed a
   strategy of short CPR self-learning sessions followed by automated
   assessment with feedback and investigated its efficiency to achieve a
   pre-defined level of compression skills.
   Methods: Four hundred and four students in pharmacy and educational
   sciences participated. Initial training (max. 40 min) consisted of a 15
   min learning-while-watching video followed by manikin exercises with
   computer voice feedback. At baseline and after training, performance was
   measured using an automated test. To be judged competent participants
   had to achieve >= 70\% compressions with depth >= 50 mm and >= 70\%
   compressions with complete release (<5 mm) and a compression rate
   between 100 and 120 min-1 within a two month period. Automated feedback
   was provided and failed participants had to retrain within two weeks.
   Retraining (max. 20 min and max. three times) was done with voice
   feedback exercises. Before retraining, the previous test result was
   displayed together with feedforward. After five months all participants
   were invited for a retention test.
   Results: After one to four sessions, 99\% (401/404) of all participants
   achieved competency. After five months 48\% (137/288) of the students
   participating in the retention test was still competent. The percentage
   competent participants was 80\% (230/288) for compression depth, 97\%
   (279/288) for complete release and 60\% (172/288) for mean rate.
   Conclusions: One or multiple short self-learning sessions were highly
   efficient to successfully train 99\% of participants. After five months,
   retention of compression depth and complete release was very high.
   However, only 48\% still achieved a 70\% combined score for compression
   skills, highlighting the importance of regular assessment and
   retraining. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {E-learning is rapidly gaining in importance in higher education. On-line
   continuing medical education has obtained good results in knowledge
   acquisition and in the learner satisfaction, although incertainty
   remains in the interaction among participants with asynchronous
   communication and in the efficacy of the learning process.
   We developed an on-line training model for palliative care in cancer
   directed to primary care physicians with the first objective to evaluate
   the efficacy of the learning process and satisfaction of the
   participants, and the second objective to evaluate the impact of the
   education in the symptom control of their patients.
   In a randomized and controlled educational trial, 169 participants all
   over the country (Spain) were divided in two groups: the intervention
   group followed an on-line program for palliative care self-training,
   while the control did not, but could follow the usual training for his
   working area. The Learning Management System used was the generic Model
   Platform. The Dreamweaver tool was used for content design, and the
   platform resources were prepared based on Word documents. Evaluation
   forums and questionnaires were conducted, complemented by other
   interactive resources (images, diagrams, videos, interactive WebPages,
   among others).
   The educational content was designed by the authors, and distributed in
   four modules with subjects. Each subject contained objectives, contents
   directed to clinical practice, with clear and concise explanations,
   bibliography and websites. The subjects included links to explanations
   for the presentation, and self-guided questions which could be reviewed
   several times, without a final score. The intervention group had two
   tutors available to answer to any doubt through the platform and forums.
   On-line training, lasting 96 hours, was conducted during 75 days, with
   15-20 days per module. The first part evaluation presented here, was
   conducted through several tools: the knowledge questionnaire, the
   attitude questionnaire, and the satisfaction and Moodle questionnaires.
   Analysis was made with SPSS (version 18) for parametric, non-parametric
   tests and imputation of missing data.
   Both groups (85 participants per group, of which five were excluded)
   were balanced in basal variables. Evaluation of access to the on-line
   platform: from 82 participants in the intervention group, 59 (72\%)
   completed all modules. The average number of visits to the platform was
   266.83 visits (SD 87.26; range 118-509). Forty-two participants (59\%)
   took part in the discussion forum. Sixty two (75.6\%) Moodle survey
   forms were received. The most frequent score was ``agree{''}, from
   52.5\% to 71\% in different questions. Twenty-seven participants
   (43.5\%) made comments regarding: on-line application difficulties, or
   subject presentation.
   Evaluation of Knowledge, Attitude and Satisfaction: from 60 (73.17\%)
   questionnaires the most frequent score was ``good{''} or ``very good{''}
   in satisfaction. A significant increase in knowledge (mean of
   differences 3.04, CI 95\% (1.51 to 4.57) p=0.0001,maximum score 33) was
   detected as well in confidence in communication (p=0.007), while it was
   non-significant (p=0.151) regarding confidence in symptom management.
   Useful aspects as well as aspects to be improved in training were
   signaled. Significant differences between groups were detected in
   knowledge, perception of confidence in symptom management and
   communication.},

   Learning (DGBL): Evaluating Learning Outcomes and Processes Among
   Science and Engineering Students},
Journal = {EMPIRICAL STUDIES OF THE ARTS},

Abstract = {The field of interdisciplinary art education, particularly through
   digital game-based learning, lacks empirical research on the art
   learning process and the competencies gained along the process. To
   address this research gap, this study collects data through experiment
   and post-experiment interviews from 20 science and engineering college
   students who participated in a 1-month digital game-based art learning
   program. The findings reveal three learning process cycles involved
   during art educational digital gameplay, namely the game action cycle,
   the experiential learning process cycle, and the game response cycle.
   Throughout the three process cycles, 29 learning outcomes were
   identified based on students' gameplay experiences. These outcomes are
   then categorized into three themes, including enhanced self-management,
   enhanced learning experience, and refinement of proprioceptive
   competencies. Overall, this study highlights the digital learning
   process in the context of interdisciplinary art education and emphasizes
   the importance of valuing the outcomes gained from digital game-based
   learning in art education.},

Title = {Linking the choice of the class format and preclass learning experiences
   sheds light on a step further in blended medical education},

Abstract = {Background The core principle of HyFlex ('hybrid' and `flexible')
   learning is to maintain learning equity under most circumstances. Within
   a blended framework in precision medical education, how different
   preferences of synchronous learning environment influence learning
   process and outcome is limited. We investigated students' preclass
   online video learning experiences and their choices toward synchronous
   class formats. Methods This was a mixed-methods study. During the 2021
   academic year, all 5th-year medical students who had viewed online video
   clips presenting core concepts were asked to complete a survey on their
   preference for future synchronous class format (face-to-face, online, or
   HyFlex) and asked to provide reflective comments on their self-learning.
   Anonymous survey data, online records, and summative assessment scores
   (short-term learning outcomes) were collected. Kruskal - Wallis or
   Chi-square tests were used to compare differences between groups, and
   multiple linear regression was managed to select the factors associated
   with various choices. The students' comments were coded in a descriptive
   thematic analysis. Results Among 152 medical students, 150 responded to
   the questionnaires, and 109 provided comments. Medical students spent a
   median of 32 min online, significantly shorter in the face-to-face group
   than in the online and HyFlex groups. The online group had a lower
   preclass video completion rate for certain concepts. The choice was not
   associated with short-term learning outcomes. Student feedback revealed
   a higher frequency of multiple themes for each student in the
   face-to-face and HyFlex groups, and these themes fell into the
   categories of learning efficiency, focus concentration, and course
   attractiveness. Conclusions Linking the choice of the class format and
   learning experiences of preclass online videos sheds light on a step
   further within a blended framework of precision medical education.
   Supplement of online interactive elements may help secure learning
   engagement among students choosing `online only' class format of HyFlex
   learning.},

Title = {Human or Humanoid Animated Pedagogical Avatars in Video Lectures: The
   Impact of the Knowledge Type on Learning Outcomes},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF HUMAN-COMPUTER INTERACTION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 OCT 17},
Abstract = {This study examines the impacts of educational videos with human or
   humanoid animated pedagogical avatars (APAs) on cognitive, affective,
   and social learning outcomes in declarative and procedural knowledge
   contexts. A 2 x 2 factorial design was used, considering instructor type
   (human vs. humanoid APA) and knowledge type (declarative vs.
   procedural). The study involved 139 university students with no prior
   knowledge of the video content and was conducted in a human-computer
   interaction lab using an eye-tracking device. There were no significant
   differences in learning achievement, perceived lecture engagement,
   emotion, satisfaction, and social presence between the human and
   humanoid APA. However, learners showed greater visual interest in the
   human instructor, which influenced their interest in the learning
   content. Viewers of declarative knowledge videos showed more visual
   interest and achieved higher learning scores, while procedural videos
   increased lecture engagement, emotion, satisfaction, and social
   presence. The study suggests that humanoid APAs can effectively replace
   human instructors in educational videos and emphasizes the importance of
   considering knowledge types in video design to impact learning outcomes.},

Title = {Evaluation of the symptom-focused health assessment and empathy program
   for undergraduate nursing students: A randomized controlled trial},
Journal = {NURSE EDUCATION TODAY},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {94},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Health assessments are a vital competency required of
   nurses. The more traditional ways of teaching and learning this skill
   require practice and are often limited by time constraints. With the
   rise of technology-based platforms, students can supplement their
   learning health assessment skills through other means, such as videos,
   that not only teach the steps but also allow them to learn in context.
   Objectives: This study describes how a symptom-focused health assessment
   and empathy (SHAE) program, which primarily involves the use of a
   case-based health assessment video, was implemented and evaluated.
   Design: The study involved a single-centre, single-blind, parallel
   randomized controlled trial.
   Settings: The study was conducted at a university in Singapore.
   Participants: Year one undergraduate nursing students enrolled in the
   Comprehensive Health Assessment (CHA) module during semester two of the
   academic year 2018/2019 participated in the study.
   Methods: Participants were randomized into one of the two parallel
   groups: the experimental group or the waitlisted control (WL) group. The
   experimental group received the SHAE program in addition to conventional
   learning methods (e-lectures, lab demonstration, and pair practice). The
   WL group received only the conventional learning methods. Pre- and
   post-test measures of the study variables such as knowledge, health
   assessment skills, confidence, empathy, and intention to learn were
   conducted. The WL group was given access to the SHAE program after the
   post-test. Analyses of covariance (ANCOVA) were used to compare the
   means of the study variables between the intervention and WL groups.
   Results: Participants in the intervention group had significantly higher
   scores on knowledge (p = 0.016), confidence (p = 0.03), and health
   assessment skills (p = 0.004). No significant differences in intention
   to learn and empathy between the two groups were found.
   Conclusion: The use of a case-based video has the potential to be a
   valuable method of teaching health assessments in context to nursing
   students. The SHAE program has shown beneficial effects on students'
   knowledge, health assessment skills, and confidence. However, there was
   no effect on students' intentions to learn and their empathy. Further
   refinements of the program will need to focus on improving these
   domains.},

   music online. These media allow producers of educational content to
   reach, interact with, and respond to a global audience of interested
   viewers. Through a multimodal analysis approach, this study examined
   guitar-related lessons, tutorials, and reviews created and shared by
   artists and enthusiasts who reached a ``celebrity{''} status on YouTube.
   Findings show that these teachers-celebrities construct their online
   presence and communicate with their audience through authenticity,
   approachability, and humor, in short-format and high-quality videos. The
   seamless integration of instructional content, branding, and references
   to the authors' personal lives and worldviews generates a unique
   teaching and learning environment that challenges traditional

   Method: This single-blinded randomized crossover trial was conducted to
   evaluate whether peer-to-peer teaching is not inferior to standard
   teaching in basic airway management for undergraduate nursing students.
   Results: Forty-eight students with the peer-to-peer Learning had
   significantly higher skill rating scores with a Large effect size
   (Cohen's d of 1.07 (p-value .002) for oropharyngeal airway insertion,
   1.14 (p-value <.001) for nasopharyngeal airway insertion, and 0.81
   (p-value .003) for bag-mask ventilation). There was no difference
   between preknowledge and postknowledge scores (p-value of .13 and .22,
   respectively). Both groups reported higher confidence.
   Conclusions: Nursing students trained in basic airway management by the
   peer-to-peer method did not show inferiority compared with the standard
   group. (C) 2020 International Nursing Association for Clinical
